<h1 class="calibre10" id="calibre_pb_0">Preface</h1>


<p class="author1">Noted software engineer and entrepreneur Marc Andreesen famously declared that <a href="https://oreil.ly/tYaNz" class="calibre5">“software is eating the world”</a>. This was back in 2011, and has only become more true over time. Software systems continue to grow in complexity and can be found in all facets of modern life. Standing in the middle of this ravenous beast is the Python language. Programmers often cite Python as a favorite <a href="https://oreil.ly/RUNNh" class="calibre5">language</a>, and it can be found everywhere: from web applications, to machine learning, to developer tools, and more.</p>

<p class="author1">Not all that glitters is gold, though. As our software systems become more complex, it becomes harder to understand how our mental models map onto the real world. If left unchecked, software systems bloat and become brittle, earning the frightening moniker “legacy code.” These codebases often come with warnings such as, “Do not touch these files; we don’t know why, but it breaks when you do,” and, “Oh, only So-and-So knows that code, and they left for a high-paying Silicon Valley job two years ago.” Software development is a young field, but these sort of statements should be terrifying to developers and businesspeople alike.</p>

<p class="author1">The truth is, to write systems that last, you need to be deliberate in the choices you make. As stated by Titus Winters, Tom Manshreck, and Hyrum Wright, “Software engineering is programming integrated over time.”<sup class="calibre11"><a data-type="noteref" id="idm45644759598552-marker" href="part0002_split_007.html#idm45644759598552" class="calibre5">1</a></sup> Your code might last a long time—I’ve stepped into projects whose code was written while I was in elementary school. How long will your code last? Will it last longer than your tenure at your current job (or when you finish maintaining that project)? How do you want your code to be received in a few years when someone is building core components from it? Do you want your successors to thank you for your foresight, or curse your name for the complexities you bore into this world?</p>

<p class="author1">Python is a wonderful language, but it occasionally makes building for the future tricky. Some proponents of other programming languages have decried Python as “not production-grade” or “useful for prototyping only,” but the truth is that many developers only scratch the surface, rather than learning all the tools and tricks for writing robust Python. Throughout this book, you’ll learn how to do better. You’ll journey through numerous ways to make Python clean and maintainable. Your future maintainers will enjoy working with your code, as it was designed up front to make things easy. So go, read this book, look toward the future, and build awesome software that will last.</p>

<section data-type="sect1" data-pdf-bookmark="Who Should Read This Book" class="preface"><div class="preface" id="idm45644759430968">
<h1 class="calibre12" id="calibre_pb_1">Who Should Read This Book</h1>

<p class="author1">This book is for any Python developer who is looking to grow the code they work on in a sustainable and maintainable fashion. This is not intended to be your first Python text; I expect that you have written Python before. You should be comfortable with Python control flow, and have worked with classes before. If you are looking for a more introductory text, I suggest reading <a href="https://oreil.ly/iIl2K" class="calibre5"><em class="calibre6">Learning Python</em></a> by Mark Lutz (O’Reilly) first.</p>

<p class="author1">While I will be covering many advanced Python topics, the goal of this book is not to be a how-to for using all of Python’s features. Instead, the features are a backdrop for a larger conversation about robustness and how your choices impact maintainability. At times I will discuss strategies that you should rarely use, if at all. That is because I want to illustrate first principles of robustness; the journey of understanding why and how we make decisions in code is more important than knowing what tools to use in an optimal scenario. In practice, the optimal scenario is a rare occurence. Use the principles in this book to draw your own conclusions from your codebase.</p>

<p class="author1">This book is not a reference book. You might call it a discussion book. Each chapter should be a starting point for developers in your organization to discuss, together, how best to apply these principles. Start a book club, discussion group, or lunch and learn to foster communication. I have proposed discussion topics in each chapter to get the converstation started. When you come across these topics, I encourage you to stop and reflect on your current codebase. Talk among your peers and use these topics as a springboard for discussing the state of your code, processes, and workflows. If you are interested in a reference book about the Python language, I heartily recommend <a href="https://oreil.ly/PVbON" class="calibre5"><em class="calibre6">Fluent Python</em></a> by Luciano Ramalho (O’Reilly; a second edition is forthcoming in late 2021).</p>

<p class="author1">A system can be robust in many different ways. It can be security hardened, scalable, fault-tolerant, or less likely to introduce new errors. Each one of these facets of robustness warrants a full book; this book is focused on preventing the developers who inherit your code from creating new faults in your system. I will show you <span class="calibre">how to communicate</span> to future developers, how to make their lives easier through <span class="calibre">architectural</span> patterns, and how to catch errors in your codebase before they make it into production. This book zeroes in on the robustness of your Python codebase, not the robustness of your system as a whole.</p>

<p class="author1">I will be covering a wealth of information, from many different areas of software, including software engineering, computer science, testing, functional programming, and object-oriented programming (OOP). I do not expect you to have a background in these fields. There are sections where I explain things at a beginner level; this is often to deconstruct how we think about core fundamentals of the language. This is, for the most part, an intermediate-level text.</p>

<p class="author1">Ideal readers include:</p>

<ul class="printings">
<li class="calibre9">
<p class="author1">Developers currently working in a large codebase, looking to find better ways to communicate with their colleagues</p>
</li>
<li class="calibre9">
<p class="author1">Primary codebase maintainers, looking for ways to help lessen the burden of future maintainers</p>
</li>
<li class="calibre9">
<p class="author1">Self-taught developers who can write Python really well but need to better understand why we do the things we do</p>
</li>
<li class="calibre9">
<p class="author1">Software engineering graduates who need a reminder of practical advice for development</p>
</li>
<li class="calibre9">
<p class="author1">Senior developers looking for a way to tie their design rationale to first principles of robustness</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p class="author1">This book focuses on writing software over time. If a lot of your code is a prototype, throwaway, or disposable in any other fashion, the advice in this book will end up creating more work than is necessary for your project. Likewise if your project is small—say, under one hundred lines of Python. Making code maintainable does add complexity; there’s no doubt about that. However, I’ll guide you through minimizing that complexity. If your code lives longer than a few weeks or grows to a considerable size, you need to consider the sustainability of your codebase.</p>

<div class="preface" id="idm45644759476696">
<section data-type="sect1" data-pdf-bookmark="About This Book" class="preface"><div class="preface" id="idm45644759713304">
<h1 class="calibre12" id="calibre_pb_2">About This Book</h1>

<p class="author1">This book covers a wide swath of knowledge, across many chapters. It is broken up into four parts:</p>
<dl class="calibre13">
<dt class="calibre14"><a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="part-num-title" href="part0004.html#part_1" class="calibre5">Part I, <em class="calibre6">Annotating Your Code with Types</em></a></dt>
<dd class="calibre15">
<p class="calibre16">We’ll start with types in Python. Types are fundamental to the language, but are not often examined in great detail. The types you choose matter, as they convey a very specific intent. We’ll examine type annotations and what specific annotations communicate to the developer. We’ll also go over typecheckers and how those help catch bugs early.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="calibre14"><a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="part-num-title" href="part0011.html#part_2" class="calibre5">Part II, <em class="calibre6">Defining Your Own Types</em></a></dt>
<dd class="calibre15">
<p class="calibre16">After covering how to think about Python’s types, we’ll focus on how to create your own types. We’ll walk through enumerations, data classes, and classes in depth. We’ll explore how making certain design choices in designing a type can increase or decrease the robustness of your code.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="calibre14"><a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="part-num-title" href="part0019.html#part_3" class="calibre5">Part III, <em class="calibre6">Extensible Python</em></a></dt>
<dd class="calibre15">
<p class="calibre16">After learning how to better express your intentions, we’ll focus on how to enable developers to change your code effortlessly, building with confidence on your strong foundation. We’ll cover extensibility, dependencies, and architectural patterns that allow you to modify your system with minimal impact.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="calibre14"><a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="part-num-title" href="part0025.html#part_4" class="calibre5">Part IV, <em class="calibre6">Building a Safety Net</em></a></dt>
<dd class="calibre15">
<p class="calibre16">Lastly, we’ll explore how to build a safety net, so that you can gently catch your future collaborators when they do fall. Their confidence will increase, knowing that they have a strong, robust system that they can fearlessly adapt to their use case. Finally, we’ll cover a variety of static analysis and testing tools that will help you catch rogue behavior.</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<p class="author1">Each chapter is mostly self-contained, with references to other chapters where applicable. You can read this book from cover to cover, or bounce around to chapters that suit your fancy. Chapters grouped in each part will be related to one another, but there will be fewer relations between book parts.</p>

<p class="author1">All code examples were run using Python 3.9.0, and I’ll try to call out when you need a specific Python version or later to run examples (such as Python 3.7 for the use of data classes).</p>

<p class="author1">Throughout this book, I will be doing most of my work on the command line. I ran all of these commands from an Ubuntu operating system, but most tools should work just as well on Mac or Windows systems. In some cases, I will show how certain tools interact with integrated development environments (IDEs), such as Visual Studio Code (VS Code). Most IDEs use the command-line options underneath the hood; most of what you learn on the command line will translate directly to IDE options.</p>

<p class="author1">This book will be presenting many different techniques that can improve the robustness of your code. However, there are no silver bullets in software development. Trade-offs are the heart of solid engineering, and there is no exception in the methods that I present. I will be transparent about benefits and drawbacks as I discuss these topics. You will know more about your systems than I will, and you are best suited to choose which tool is appropriate for which job. All I am doing is stocking your toolbox.</p>

<h1 class="calibre12" id="calibre_pb_7">Acknowledgments</h1>

<p class="author1">I would like to acknowledge my incredible wife, Kendall. She is my support and sounding board, and I appreciate everything she did to make sure that I had the time and space to write this book.</p>

<p class="author1">No book is written in isolation, and this book is no exception. I stand on the shoulders of giants in the software industry, and I appreciate all who came before me.</p>

<p class="author1">I also would like to thank everyone who was involved in reviewing this book to make sure that my messaging was consistent and that my examples were clear. Thank you to Bruce G., David K., David P., and Don P. for providing early feedback and helping me decide on a direction for this book. Thank you to my tech reviewers Charles Givre, Drew Winstel, Jennifer Wilcox, Jordan Goldmeier, Nathan Stocks, and Jess Males for their invaluable feedback, especially where things really only made sense in my head but not on paper. Lastly, thank you to anyone who read the early release draft and was kind enough to email me their thoughts, especially Daniel C. and <span class="calibre">Francesco</span>.</p>

<p class="author1">I’d like to thank everyone who helped transform my final draft into something production-worthy. Thank you to Justin Billing for diving deep as a copyeditor and helping refine the presentation of my ideas. Thank you to Shannon Turlington for proofreading; the book is much more polished because of you. A big thank you goes to Ellen Troutman-Zaig, who produced a fantastic index that I was blown away by.</p>

<p class="author1">Lastly, I could not do this without the fabulous team at O’Reilly. Thank you to Amanda Quinn for helping me through the proposal process and helping me develop focus for the book. Thank you to Kristen Brown for making the production stage incredibly easy for me. Thank you to Kate Dullea, who converted my MS Paint-quality sketches into clean, crisp illustrations. Also, I would like to give a tremendous thank you to my developmental editor, Sarah Grey. I looked forward to our weekly meetings, and she was fantastic in helping me craft a book for a broad audience, while still letting me dive deep into technical details.</p>
