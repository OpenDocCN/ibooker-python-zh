- en: The chapters in this part provide a thousand-foot view of FastAPI—more like
    a drone than a spy satellite. They cover the basics quickly but stay above the
    water line to avoid drowning you in details. The chapters are relatively short
    and are meant to provide context for the depths of [Part III](part03.html#part3).

- en: After you get used to the ideas in this part, [Part III](part03.html#part3)
    zooms into those details. That’s where you can do some serious good, or damage.
    No judgment; it’s up to you.
