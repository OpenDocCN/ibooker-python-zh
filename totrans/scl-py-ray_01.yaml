  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We wrote this book for developers and data scientists looking to build and scale
    applications in Python without becoming systems administrators. We expect this
    book to be most beneficial for individuals and teams dealing with the growing
    complexity and scale of problems moving from single-threaded solutions to multithreaded,
    all the way to distributed computing.

- en: While you can use Ray from Java, this book is in Python, and we assume a general
    familiarity with the Python ecosystem. If you are not familiar with Python, excellent
    O’Reilly titles include [*Learning Python*](https://oreil.ly/uPun0) by Mark Lutz
    and [*Python for Data Analysis*](https://oreil.ly/F1xgP) by Wes McKinney.

- en: '*Serverless* is a bit of a buzzword, and despite its name, the serverless model
    does involve rather a lot of servers, but the idea is you don’t have to manage
    them explicitly. For many developers and data scientists, the promise of having
    things magically scale without worrying about the servers’ details is quite appealing.
    On the other hand, if you enjoy getting into the nitty-gritty of your servers,
    deployment mechanisms, and load balancers, this is probably not the book for you—​but
    hopefully, you will recommend this to your colleagues.'

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In reading this book, you will learn how to use your existing Python skills
    to enable programs to scale beyond a single machine. You will learn about techniques
    for distributed computing, from remote procedure calls to actors, and all the
    way to distributed datasets and machine learning. We wrap up this book with a
    “real-ish” example in [Appendix A](app01.html#appA) that uses many of these techniques
    to build a scalable backend, while integrating with a Python-based web-application
    and deploying on Kubernetes.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As the saying goes, with great power comes great responsibility. Ray, and tools
    like it, enable you to build more complex systems handling more data and users.
    It’s important not to get too excited and carried away solving problems because
    they are fun, and stop to ask yourself about the impact of your decisions.

- en: You don’t have to search very hard to find stories of well-meaning engineers
    and data scientists accidentally building models or tools that caused devastating
    impacts, such as breaking the new United States Department of Veteran Affairs
    payment system, or hiring algorithms that discriminate on the basis of gender.
    We ask that you keep this in mind when using your newfound powers, for one never
    wants to end up in a textbook for the wrong reasons.

    [Chapter 8](ch08.html#ch08) with us. This book would not exist if not for the
    communities it is built on. Thank you to the Ray/Berkeley community and the PyData
    community. Thank you to all the early readers and reviewers for your contributions
    and guidance. These reviewers include Dean Wampler, Jonathan Dinu, Adam Breindel,
    Bill Chambers, Trevor Grant, Ruben Berenguel, Michael Behrendt, and many more.
    A special thanks to Ann Spencer for reviewing the early proposals of what eventually
    became this and [*Scaling Python with Dask*](https://oreil.ly/fm857) (O’Reilly),
    which Holden coauthored with Mika Kimmins. Huge thanks to the O’Reilly editorial
    and production teams, especially Virginia Wilson and Gregory Hyman, for helping
    us get our writing into shape and tirelessly working with us to minimize errors,
    typos, etc. Any remaining mistakes are the authors’ fault, sometimes against the
    advice of our reviewers and editors.
