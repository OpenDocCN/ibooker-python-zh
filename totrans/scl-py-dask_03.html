<h1><span class="label">Chapter 3. </span>How Dask Works: The Basics</h1>


<p>Now that you’ve run your first few tasks with Dask, it’s time to learn a little bit about what’s happening behind the scenes. Depending on whether you are using Dask locally or in a distributed fashion, the behavior can be a little different. While Dask does a good job of abstracting away many of the details of running on multiple threads or servers, having a solid grasp of how Dask is working will help you better decide both how and when to use it.</p>

<p>To be familiar with Dask, you need to understand:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>The deployment framework that Dask is able to run on, and its strengths and weaknesses</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The types of data that Dask is able to read, and how you can interact with the data types in Dask</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The computational pattern of Dask, and how to turn your ideas into Dask code</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How to monitor and troubleshoot</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>In this chapter, we will introduce each of these concepts, and we will expand upon them in the rest of the book.</p>






<section data-type="sect1" data-pdf-bookmark="Execution Backends"><div class="sect1" id="id16">
<h1>Execution Backends</h1>

<p>Dask has many different execution <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="execution backends" id="id373"/>backends, but we find it easiest to think about them in two groups, local and distributed. With local backends, you are limited in scale to what a single computer can handle. Local backends also have advantages like the avoidance of network overhead, simpler library management, and a lower dollar cost.<sup><a data-type="noteref" id="id374-marker" href="ch03.xhtml#id374">1</a></sup> Dask’s distributed backend has many options for deployment, from cluster managers such as Kubernetes to job queue–like systems.</p>








<section data-type="sect2" data-pdf-bookmark="Local Backends"><div class="sect2" id="id17">
<h2>Local Backends</h2>

<p>Dask’s three local backends are <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="execution backends" data-secondary="local backends" id="xcbkckd"/><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="local backends" id="lclbck"/>single-process, multi-threaded, and multi-process. The single-process backend has no parallelism and is mostly useful for validating that a problem is caused by concurrency. Multi-threaded and multi-process backends <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="multi-threaded backends" id="mlttdb"/><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="execution backends" data-secondary="multi-threaded backends" id="xckmck"/>are ideal for problems in which the data is small or the cost of copying it would be higher than computation time.</p>
<div data-type="tip"><h6>Tip</h6>
<p>If you don’t configure a specific local backend, Dask will pick the backend based on the library you are working with.</p>
</div>

<p>The local multi-threaded scheduler is able to avoid having to serialize data and interprocess communication costs. The multi-threaded backend is suited for tasks in which the majority of the computation is happening in native code, outside of Python. This is the case for many numeric libraries, such as pandas and NumPy. If that is the case for you, you can configure Dask to use multi-threading, as shown in <a data-type="xref" href="#configure_dask_multithreading_ch03_1686241430957">Example 3-1</a>.</p>

<h2>Distributed (Dask Client and Scheduler)</h2>

<p>While Dask can work well locally, its true power comes with the distributed scheduler, with which you can scale your problem to multiple machines. Since there are physical and financial limits to how much computing power, storage, and memory can be put into one machine, using multiple machines is often the most cost-efficient solution (and it is sometimes the only solution).
Distributed computing is not without its drawbacks; as Leslie Lamport famously said, “A distributed system is one in which the failure of a computer you didn’t even know existed can render your own computer unusable.” While Dask does much to limit these failures (see <a data-type="xref" href="#fault_tolerance_ch03_1688739701115">“Fault Tolerance”</a>), you accept some increase in complexity when moving to a distributed system.</p>

<p>Dask has one distributed scheduler backend, and <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="execution backends" data-secondary="distributed" id="xcbckd"/><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="distributed scheduler" id="dstbscd"/><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="Dask client" id="id382"/>it talks to many different types of clusters, including a LocalCluster. Each type of cluster is supported in its own library, which schedules the scheduler<sup><a data-type="noteref" id="id383-marker" href="ch03.xhtml#id383">4</a></sup> that the Dask client then connects to. Using the distributed abstraction <code>dask.distributed</code> gives you portability <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="distributed function" id="id384"/><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="functions" data-secondary="distributed" id="id385"/>between any types of cluster you may be using at the moment, including local. If you don’t use <code>dask​.dis⁠tributed</code>, Dask can still run perfectly well on a local computer, in which case you are using a default single-machine scheduler provided in the Dask library.</p>

<p>The Dask client is your entry point into the Dask distributed scheduler. In this chapter, we will be using Dask with a Kubernetes cluster; if you have another type of cluster or want details, please see <a data-type="xref" href="ch12.xhtml#ch12">Chapter 12</a>.</p>










<section data-type="sect3" class="pagebreak-before less_space" data-pdf-bookmark="Auto-scaling"><div class="sect3" id="id19">
<h3>Auto-scaling</h3>

<p>With auto-scaling, Dask can increase or decrease the computers/resources being used, based on the tasks you have asked it to run.<sup><a data-type="noteref" id="id386-marker" href="ch03.xhtml#id386">5</a></sup> For example, if you have a program that computes complex aggregations using many computers but then mostly operates on the aggregated data, the number of computers you need could decrease by a large amount post-aggregation. Many workloads, including machine learning, do not need the same amount of resources/computers the entire time.</p>

<p>Some of Dask’s cluster backends, including <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="execution backends" data-secondary="cluster backends" data-tertiary="auto-scaling" id="id387"/><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="execution backends" data-secondary="cluster backends" data-tertiary="adaptive deployments" id="id388"/><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="adaptive deployments" id="id389"/><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="auto-scaling" data-secondary="cluster backends" id="id390"/><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="Dask client" data-secondary="auto-scaling" id="id391"/>Kubernetes, support auto-scaling, which Dask calls <em>adaptive deployments</em>. Auto-scaling is useful mostly in situations of shared cluster resources, or when running on cloud providers where the underlying resources are paid for by the hour.</p>

<section data-type="sect3" data-pdf-bookmark="Important limitations with the Dask client"><div class="sect3" id="id155">
<h3>Important limitations with the Dask client</h3>

<p>Dask’s client is not fault tolerant, so while <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="Dask client" data-secondary="limitations" id="id392"/>Dask can handle the failures of its workers, if the connection between the client and the scheduler is broken, your application will fail. A common workaround for this is scheduling the client within the same environment as the scheduler, although this does somewhat reduce the usefulness of having the client and scheduler as separate components.</p>
</div></section>










<section data-type="sect3" data-pdf-bookmark="Libraries and dependencies in distributed clusters"><div class="sect3" id="id20">
<h3>Libraries and dependencies in distributed clusters</h3>

<p>Part of why Dask is so powerful <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="execution backends" data-secondary="distributed" data-tertiary="libraries" id="id393"/><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="distributed scheduler" data-secondary="libraries" id="id394"/><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="execution backends" data-secondary="distributed" data-tertiary="dependencies" id="id395"/><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="distributed scheduler" data-secondary="dependencies" id="id396"/><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="libraries" data-secondary="distributed clusters" id="id397"/><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="dependencies" data-secondary="distributed clusters" id="id398"/><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="Python" data-secondary="ecosystem, Dask and" id="id399"/>is the Python ecosystem that it is in. While Dask will pickle, or serialize (see <a data-type="xref" href="#ser_pick_dtl">“Serialization and Pickling”</a>), and send our code to the workers, this doesn’t include the libraries we use.<sup><a data-type="noteref" id="id400-marker" href="ch03.xhtml#id400">6</a></sup> To take advantage of that ecosystem, you need to be able to use additional libraries. During the exploration phase, it is common to install packages at runtime as you discover that you need them.</p>

<p class="pagebreak-after">The <code>PipInstall</code> worker plug-in takes a list <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="PipInstall plug-in" id="id401"/>of packages and installs them at runtime on all of the workers. Looking back at <a data-type="xref" href="ch02.xhtml#web_crawler_ch02_1688747981454">Example 2-4</a>, to install bs4 you would call 
<span class="keep-together"><code>distributed.diagnostics.plugin.PipInstall(["bs4"])</code>.</span> Any new workers that are launched by Dask then need to wait for the package to be installed. The <code>Pip​Install</code> plug-in is ideal for quick prototyping when you are discovering which packages you need. You can think of <code>PipInstall</code> as the replacement for <code>!pip install</code> in a notebook over having a virtualenv.</p>

<p>To avoid the slowness of having <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="libraries" data-secondary="pre-installing" id="id402"/>to install packages each time a new worker is launched, you should try to pre-install your libraries. Each cluster <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="dependencies" data-secondary="cluster managers" id="id403"/><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="CMs (cluster managers)" data-secondary="dependencies" id="id404"/>manager (e.g., YARN, Kubernetes, Coiled, Saturn, etc.) has its own methods for managing dependencies. This can happen at runtime or at setup where the packages are pre-installed. The specifics for the different cluster managers are covered in <a data-type="xref" href="ch12.xhtml#ch12">Chapter 12</a>.</p>

<p>With Kubernetes, for example, the default startup script checks for the presence of some key environment variables (<code>EXTRA_APT_PACKAGES</code>, <code>EXTRA_CONDA_PACKAGES</code>, and <code>EXTRA_PIP_PACKAGES</code>), which, in conjunction with customized worker specs, can be used to add dependencies at runtime. Some of them, like Coiled and Kubernetes, allow for adding dependencies when building an image for our workers. Others, like YARN, use preallocated conda/virtual environment packing.</p>
<div data-type="warning" epub:type="warning"><h6>Warning</h6>
<p>It is very important to have the same versions of Python and libraries installed on all of the workers and your client. Different versions of libraries can lead to outright failures or subtler <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="execution backends" data-secondary="distributed" data-startref="xcbckd" id="id405"/><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="distributed scheduler" data-startref="dstbscd" id="id406"/>data correctness issues.</p>

<h1>Dask’s Diagnostics User Interface</h1>

<p>One of your first stops in understanding what your <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="Diagnostics UI" id="id407"/>program is doing should be Dask’s Diagnostics UI. The UI allows you to see what Dask is executing, the number of worker threads/processes/computers, memory utilization information, and much more. If you are running Dask locally, you will likely find the UI at 
<span class="keep-together"><em>http:​//localhost:8787</em></span>.</p>

<p>If you’re using the Dask client to connect to a cluster, the UI will be running on the scheduler node. You can get the link to the dashboard from <code>client.dashboard_link</code>.</p>
<div data-type="tip"><h6>Tip</h6>
<p>For remote notebook users, the hostname of <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="Diagnostics UI" data-secondary="notebook users" id="id408"/>the scheduler node may not be reachable directly from your computer.

<h1>Serialization and Pickling</h1>

<p>Distributed and parallel systems <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="serialization" id="id409"/><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="pickling" id="id410"/><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="Python" data-secondary="pickling" id="id411"/>depend on serialization, sometimes called <em>pickling</em> in Python, to share data and functions/code between processes. Dask uses a mixture of serialization techniques to match the use case and provides hooks to extend by class when the defaults don’t meet your needs.</p>
<div data-type="warning" epub:type="warning"><h6>Warning</h6>
<p>We most often think of serialization when it fails (with an error), but equally important can be situations where we end up serializing more data than we need—or when the amount of data that needs to be transferred is so large that distributing the work is no longer beneficial.</p>
</div>

<p>Cloudpickle serializes the functions <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="pickling" data-secondary="Cloudpickle" id="id412"/><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="Cloudpickle" id="id413"/><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="serialization" data-secondary="Cloudpickle" id="id414"/>and the generic Python types in Dask. Most Python code doesn’t depend on serializing functions, but cluster computing often does. Cloudpickle is a project designed for cluster computing and is able to serialize and deserialize more functions than Python’s built-in pickle.</p>
<div data-type="warning" epub:type="warning"><h6>Warning</h6>
<p>Dask has its own ability to extend <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="serialization" data-secondary="extending" id="id415"/>serialization, but the registry methods are not automatically sent to the workers, and it’s not always used.<sup><a data-type="noteref" id="id416-marker" href="ch03.xhtml#id416">7</a></sup></p>
</div>

<p>Dask has built-in special <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="serialization" data-secondary="NumPy arrays" id="id417"/><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="serialization" data-secondary="sparse" id="id418"/><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="serialization" data-secondary="cuPY" id="id419"/><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="NumPy" data-secondary="arrays" id="id420"/><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="sparse" id="id421"/><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="cuPY" id="id422"/>handling for NumPy arrays, sparse, and cuPY. These serializations tend to be more space efficient than the default serializers. When you make a class that contains one of these types and does not require any special initialization, you should call <code>register_generic(YourClass)</code> from <code>dask.distributed.protocol</code> to take advantage of Dask’s special handling.</p>

<p>If you have a class that is not serializable, as in <a data-type="xref" href="#fail_to_ser">Example 3-4</a>, you can wrap it to add serialization functions to it, as shown in <a data-type="xref" href="#custom_ser_with_pickle">Example 3-5</a>.</p>

<h1>Partitioning/Chunking Collections</h1>

<p>Partitioning gives you the ability <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="partitioning" data-seealso="chunking" id="id423"/><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="chunking" id="id424"/>to control the number of tasks used to process your data. If you have billions of rows, using one task for each row would mean you spend more time scheduling the tasks than doing the work itself. Understanding partitioning is key to being able to make the most efficient use of Dask.</p>

<p>Dask uses slightly different terminology for partitioning in each of its collections. In Dask, partitioning impacts how data is located on your cluster, and the right partitioning for your problem can make order-of-magnitude improvements. Partitioning has a few different aspects, like the size of each partition, the number of partitions, and optional properties such as partition key and sorted versus unsorted.</p>

<p>The number and size of partitions are closely related and impact the maximum parallelism. Partitions that are too small or too great in number mean that Dask will spend more time scheduling the tasks than running them. A general sweet spot for partition size is around 100 MB to 1 GB, but if your computation per element is very expensive, smaller partition sizes can perform better.</p>

<p>Ideally, your partitions should be similar <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="partitioning" data-secondary="skewed partitions" id="id425"/>in size to avoid stragglers. A situation in which you’ve got partitions of different sizes is called <em>skewed</em>. There are many different sources of skew, ranging from input file sizes to key skew (when keyed). When your data gets too skewed, you will need to repartition the data.</p>

<p>Dask arrays’ partitions are called <em>chunks</em> and <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="arrays" data-secondary="chunks" id="id426"/><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="chunking" data-secondary="arrays" id="id427"/>represent the number of elements. Although Dask always knows the number of chunks, when you apply a filter or load data, Dask is unaware of the size of each chunk. Indexing or slicing a Dask array requires that Dask know the chunk sizes so it can find the chunk(s) with the desired elements. Depending on how your Dask array was created, Dask may or may not know the size of each chunk. We talk about this more in <a data-type="xref" href="ch05.xhtml#ch05">Chapter 5</a>. If you want to index into an array where Dask does not know the chunk sizes, you will need to first call <code>compute_chunk_sizes()</code> on the array. When creating a Dask array from a local collection, you can specify the target chunk size, as shown in <a data-type="xref" href="#custom_array_chunk_size">Example 3-6</a>.</p>

<section data-type="sect2" data-pdf-bookmark="Dask Bags"><div class="sect2" id="id157">
<h2>Dask Bags</h2>

<p>Dask bags’ partitions <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="bags" data-secondary="partitions" id="id428"/><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="partitioning" data-secondary="bags" id="id429"/>are called <em>partitions</em>. Unlike with Dask arrays, since Dask bags do not support indexing, Dask does not track the number of elements in each partition. When you use <code>scatter</code>, Dask will try to partition the data as well as possible, but subsequent iterations can change the number of elements inside each partition. Similar to Dask arrays, when creating from a local collection, you can specify the number of partitions of a bag, except the parameter is called <code>npartitions</code> instead of <code>chunks</code>.</p>

<p>You can change the number of partitions in a bag by calling <code>repartition</code> with either <code>npartitions</code> (for a fixed number of partitions) or <code>partition_size</code> (for a target size of each partition). Specifying <code>partition_size</code> is more expensive since Dask needs to do some extra computation to determine what the matching number of partitions would be.</p>

<p>You can think of data as keyed when there is an index or when the data can be looked up by a value, such as in a hashtable. While bags implement keyed operations like <code>groupBy</code>, where values with the same key are combined, their partitioning does not have any idea of key and instead keyed operations always operate on all partitions.<sup><a data-type="noteref" id="id430-marker" href="ch03.xhtml#id430">8</a></sup></p>

<section data-type="sect2" data-pdf-bookmark="Dask DataFrames"><div class="sect2" id="dask_df">
<h2>Dask DataFrames</h2>

<p>DataFrames have the most options <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="partitioning" data-secondary="Dask DataFrames" id="id431"/><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="Dask DataFrames" data-secondary="partitioning" id="id432"/>for partitioning. DataFrames can have partitions of different sizes, as well as known or unknown partitioning. With unknown partitioning, the data is distributed, but Dask is unable to determine which partition holds a particular key. Unknown partitioning happens often, as any operation that could change the value of a key results in unknown partitioning. The <code>known_divisions</code> property on a DataFrame allows you to see whether Dask knows the partitioning, and the <code>index</code> property shows the splits used and the column.</p>

<p>If a DataFrame has the right partitioning, operations like <code>groupBy</code>, which would normally involve a lot of internode communication, can be executed with less communication. Accessing rows by ID requires that the DataFrame is partitioned on that key. If you want to change the column that your DataFrame is partitioned on, you can call <code>set_index</code> to change the index. Setting the index, like all the repartitioning operations, involves copying the data between workers, known as a <em>shuffle</em>.</p>

<section data-type="sect2" data-pdf-bookmark="Shuffles"><div class="sect2" id="id24">
<h2>Shuffles</h2>

<p>Shuffling refers to transferring <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="partitioning" data-secondary="shuffles" id="id433"/><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="shuffles" id="id434"/>data between different workers to repartition the data. Shuffling can be the result of an explicit operation, like calling <code>repartition</code>, or an implicit one, like grouping data together by key or performing an aggregation. Shuffles tend to be relatively expensive, so it’s useful to minimize how often they are needed and also to reduce the amount of data they move.</p>

<p>The most straightforward case to understand shuffles is when you explicitly ask Dask to repartition your data. In those cases you generally see many-to-many worker communication, with the majority of the data needing to be moved over the network. This is naturally more expensive than situations in which data is able to be processed locally, as the network is much slower than RAM.</p>

<p>Another important way that you can trigger shuffles is implicitly through a reduction/aggregation. In such cases, if parts of the reduction or aggregation can be applied prior to moving the data around, Dask is able to transfer less data over the network, making for a faster shuffle.</p>
<div data-type="tip"><h6>Tip</h6>

<h2>Partitions During Load</h2>

<p>So far you’ve seen how to control partitions <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="partitioning" data-secondary="during load" id="id437"/>when creating from a local collection, as well as how to change the partitioning of an existing distributed collection. Partitioning during the creation of a collection from delayed tasks is generally 1:1, with each delayed task being its own partition. When loading data from files, partitioning becomes a bit more complicated, involving file layout and compression. Generally speaking, it is good practice to look at the partitioning of data you have loaded by calling <code>npartitions</code> for bags, <code>chunks</code> for arrays, or <code>index</code> for DataFrames.</p>

<section data-type="sect1" data-pdf-bookmark="Tasks, Graphs, and Lazy Evaluation"><div class="sect1" id="id254">
<h1>Tasks, Graphs, and Lazy Evaluation</h1>

<p>Tasks are the building blocks that Dask uses to implement <code>dask.delayed</code>, futures, and operations on Dask’s collections. Each task represents a small piece of computation that Dask cannot break down any further. Tasks are often fine-grained, and when computing a result Dask will try to combine multiple tasks into a single execution.</p>








<section data-type="sect2" data-pdf-bookmark="Lazy Evaluation"><div class="sect2" id="lazy_eval">
<h2>Lazy Evaluation</h2>

<p>Most of Dask is lazily evaluated, <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="lazy evaluation" id="id438"/>with the exception of Dask futures. Lazy evaluation shifts the responsibility for combining computations from you to the scheduler. This means that Dask will, when it makes sense, combine multiple function calls. Not only that, but if only some parts of a structure are needed, Dask is sometimes able to optimize by evaluating just the relevant parts (like <code>head</code> or <code>tail</code> calls).<sup><a data-type="noteref" id="id439-marker" href="ch03.xhtml#id439">9</a></sup> Implementing lazy evaluation requires Dask to construct a task graph. This task graph is <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="task graphs" id="id440"/><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="graphs" data-secondary="task graphs" id="id441"/><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="fault tolerance" data-secondary="task graphs" id="id442"/>also reused for fault tolerance.</p>

<p>Unlike most of Dask, futures are eagerly evaluated, which limits the optimizations available when chaining them together, as the scheduler has a less complete view of the world when it starts executing the first future. Futures still create task graphs, and you can verify this by visualizing them in the next section.</p>

<p>Unlike the rest of Dask, futures are eagerly evaluated, which limits the optimizations available when chaining them together, as the scheduler has a less complete view of the world when it starts executing the first future.

This can be less than optimal when we need to perform multiple computations on the same piece of data. One solution to this is combining all our execution together into one call to <code>dask.compute</code>, so that Dask is able to keep the data around as needed. This breaks down in both the interactive case, where we don’t know in advance what our computation is going to be, and iterative cases. In those cases, some form of caching or persistence can be beneficial. You will learn about how to apply caching later in this chapter.</p>

<section data-type="sect2" data-pdf-bookmark="Task Sizing"><div class="sect2" id="id161">
<h2>Task Sizing</h2>

<p>Dask uses a centralized scheduler, which <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="tasks" data-secondary="sizing" id="id453"/>is a common technique for many systems. It does mean, however, that while the general task scheduling overhead is 1 ms, as the number of tasks in a system increases the scheduler can become a bottleneck, and the overhead can grow. Counterintuitively, this means that as our system grows we may benefit from larger, coarser-grained tasks.</p>
</div></section>








<section data-type="sect2" data-pdf-bookmark="When Task Graphs Get Too Large"><div class="sect2" id="id162">
<h2>When Task Graphs Get Too Large</h2>

<p>Sometimes the task graph itself can <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="task graphs" data-secondary="large" id="tkgpg"/><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="graphs" data-secondary="task graphs" data-tertiary="large" id="gptkgp"/>become too much for Dask to handle. This issue can show up as an out-of-memory exception on the client or scheduler or, more commonly, as jobs that slow down with iterations. Most frequently this occurs with recursive algorithms. One common example of a situation in which the graph can become too expensive to keep is distributed alternating least squares.</p>

<p>The first step when encountering a situation with a too-large task graph is to see if you can reduce the parallelism by using larger chunks of work or by switching the algorithm. For example, if we think of Fibonacci numbers computed with recursion, a better option would be using a dynamic programming or memoized solution instead of trying to distribute the computation task with Dask.</p>

<p>If you have an iterative algorithm, and there isn’t a better way to accomplish what you want, you can help Dask out by periodically writing out the intermediate work and re-loading it.<sup><a data-type="noteref" id="id454-marker" href="ch03.xhtml#id454">10</a></sup> By doing this, Dask does not have to keep track of all of the steps involved in creating the data, but instead just needs to remember where the data is.

<h2>Combining Computation</h2>

First off, when you’re blocking on the result with <code>dask.compute</code>, small batches can limit the parallelism. If you have a shared parent—say, two results on the same data—submitting the computations together allows Dask to share the computation of the underlying data. You can verify whether Dask is able to share a common node by calling <code>visualize</code> on your list of tasks (e.g., if you take Examples <a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="select:labelnumber" href="ch02.xhtml#wc_freq">2-8</a> and <a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="select:labelnumber" href="ch02.xhtml#wc_func">2-9</a> and visualize both the tasks together, you’ll see the shared node in <a data-type="xref" href="#vis_ex">Figure 3-2</a>).</p>

<section data-type="sect1" data-pdf-bookmark="Fault Tolerance"><div class="sect1" id="fault_tolerance_ch03_1688739701115">
<h1>Fault Tolerance</h1>

<p>In distributed systems like Dask, <em>fault tolerance</em> generally refers to how a system handles computer, network, or program failures.
Fault tolerance becomes increasingly important the more computers you use. When you are using Dask on a single computer, the concept of fault tolerance is less important, since if your one computer fails, there is nothing to recover. However, when you have hundreds of machines, the odds of a machine failing go up.
Dask’s task graph is used to <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="fault tolerance" id="flttlr"/>provide its fault tolerance.<sup><a data-type="noteref" id="id465-marker" href="ch03.xhtml#id465">11</a></sup>
There are many different kinds of failures in a distributed system, but thankfully many of them can be handled in the same way.</p>

<p>Dask automatically retries tasks when the scheduler loses connection to the worker. This retry is accomplished by using the same graph of computation Dask uses for lazy evaluation.</p>
<div data-type="warning" epub:type="warning"><h6>Warning</h6>
<p>The Dask client is <em>not</em> fault tolerant to network issues connecting to the scheduler. One mitigation technique you can use is to run your client in the same network as the scheduler.</p>
</div>

<p>Machine failure is a fact of life with distributed systems. When a worker fails, Dask will treat it in the same way as a network failure, retrying any necessary tasks. However, Dask cannot recover from failures of the scheduler of your client code.<sup><a data-type="noteref" id="id466-marker" href="ch03.xhtml#id466">12</a></sup> This makes it important that, when you are running in a shared environment, you run your client and scheduler nodes at a high priority to avoid preemption.</p>

<p>Dask automatically retries software failures that exit or crash the worker. Much like machine failure, from Dask’s point of view a worker exiting and a network failing look the same.</p>

<p>IOError and OSError exceptions are <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="exceptions" data-secondary="IOError" id="id467"/><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="exceptions" data-secondary="OSError" id="id468"/><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="IOError exception" id="id469"/><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="OSError exception" id="id470"/>the only two classes of exceptions Dask will retry. If your worker process raises one of these errors, the exception is pickled and transferred over to the scheduler. Dask’s scheduler then retries the task. If your code encounters an IOError that should not be retried (e.g., a web page doesn’t exist), you’ll need to wrap it in another exception to keep Dask from retrying it.</p>

<p>Since Dask retries failed computation, it’s important to be careful with side effects or changing values. For example, if you have a Dask bag of transactions and were to update a database as part of a <code>map</code>, Dask might re-execute some of the operations on that bag multiple times, resulting in the update to the database happening more than once. If we think of a withdrawal from an ATM, we can see how this would result in some unhappy customers and incorrect data. Instead, if you need to mutate small bits of data, you can bring them back to a local collection.</p>

<p>If your program encounters any other exceptions, Dask will <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="fault tolerance" data-startref="flttlr" id="id471"/>return the exception to your main thread.<sup><a data-type="noteref" id="id472-marker" href="ch03.xhtml#id472">13</a></sup></p>

So a DataFrame created from many individual tasks that you call <code>head</code> on is a great candidate for Dask to optimize, but for a single task making a large DataFrame, Dask is unable to break “inside.”</p><p data-type="footnote" id="id454"><sup><a href="ch03.xhtml#id454-marker">10</a></sup> You could also collect and scatter if the dataset is small enough.</p><p data-type="footnote" id="id465"><sup><a href="ch03.xhtml#id465-marker">11</a></sup> The same technique used in Spark.</p><p data-type="footnote" id="id466"><sup><a href="ch03.xhtml#id466-marker">12</a></sup> This is common for most systems like this.

Spark will retry most exceptions, whereas Dask will only retry errors resulting in a worker exiting, or an IOError or OSError.</p></div></div></section></div></body></html>
