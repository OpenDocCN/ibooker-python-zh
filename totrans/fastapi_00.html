<h1>Preface</h1>&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
<p>This is a pragmatic introduction to FastAPI—a modern Python web framework. It’s also a story of how,&#13;
now and then,&#13;
the bright and shiny objects that we stumble across&#13;
can turn out to be very useful.&#13;
A silver bullet is nice to have when you encounter a werewolf.&#13;
(And you will encounter werewolves later in this book.)</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>I started programming scientific applications in the mid-1970s.&#13;
And after I first met Unix and C on a PDP-11 in 1977,&#13;
I had a feeling that this Unix thing might catch on.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>In the ’80s and early ’90s, the internet was still noncommercial,&#13;
but already a good source for free software and technical info.&#13;
And when a web browser called Mosaic&#13;
was distributed on the baby open internet in 1993,&#13;
I had a feeling that this web thing might catch on.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>When I started my own web development company a few years later,&#13;
my tools were the usual suspects at the time:  PHP, HTML, and Perl.&#13;
On a contract job a few years later, I finally experimented with Python&#13;
and was surprised at how quickly I was able to access, manipulate,&#13;
and display data.&#13;
In my spare time over two weeks, I was able to replicate most of&#13;
a C application that had taken four developers a year to write.&#13;
Now I had a feeling that this Python thing might catch on.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>After that, most of my work involved Python&#13;
and its web frameworks, mostly Flask and Django.&#13;
I particularly liked the simplicity of Flask&#13;
and preferred it for many jobs.&#13;
But just a few years ago,&#13;
I spied something glinting in the underbrush: a new Python web framework called FastAPI,&#13;
written by&#13;
Sebastián Ramírez.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>As I read his (excellent)&#13;
<a href="https://fastapi.tiangolo.com">documentation</a>,&#13;
I was impressed by the design and thought that had gone into it.&#13;
In particular, his&#13;
<a href="https://oreil.ly/Ds-xM">history</a>&#13;
page showed how much care he had taken evaluating alternatives.&#13;
This was not an ego project or a fun experiment,&#13;
but a serious framework for&#13;
real-world development.&#13;
Now I had a feeling that this FastAPI thing might catch on.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p class="pagebreak-before">I wrote a biomedical API site with FastAPI,&#13;
and it went so well that a team of us rewrote our old core API&#13;
with FastAPI in the next year.&#13;
This is still in production and has held up well.&#13;
Our group learned the basics that you’ll read in this book,&#13;
and all felt that we were writing better code, faster,&#13;
with fewer bugs.&#13;
And by the way, some of us had not written in Python before,&#13;
and only I had used FastAPI.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>So when I had an opportunity to suggest a follow-up to my&#13;
<em>Introducing Python</em> book to O’Reilly,&#13;
FastAPI was at the top of my list.&#13;
In my opinion, FastAPI will have at least the impact&#13;
that Flask and Django have had, and maybe more.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>As I’ve mentioned,&#13;
the FastAPI website itself provides world-class documentation,&#13;
including many details on the usual web topics: databases,&#13;
authentication, deployment, and so on.&#13;
So why write a book?</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>This book isn’t meant to be exhaustive because,&#13;
well, that’s exhausting.&#13;
It <em>is</em> meant to be useful—to help you quickly&#13;
pick up the main ideas of FastAPI and apply them.&#13;
I will point out various techniques that required some sleuthing&#13;
and offer advice on day-to-day best practices.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>I start each chapter with a Preview of what’s coming.&#13;
Next, I try not to forget what I just promised,&#13;
offering details and random asides.&#13;
Finally, there’s a brief digestible Review.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>As the saying goes,&#13;
“These are the opinions on which my facts are based.”&#13;
Your experience will be unique,&#13;
but I hope that you will find enough of value here to become&#13;
a more productive web developer.</p>&#13;
