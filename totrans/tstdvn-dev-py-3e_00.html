<h1>Preface</h1>
<p>This book is my attempt to share with the world the journey I’ve taken from
“hacking” to “software engineering”. It’s mainly about testing, but there’s a
lot more to it, as you’ll soon see.</p>
<p>I want to thank you for reading it.</p>
<p>If you bought a copy, then I’m very grateful.  If you’re reading the free
online version, then I’m <em>still</em> grateful that you’ve decided it’s worth
spending some of your time on. Who knows, perhaps once you get to the end,
you’ll decide it’s good enough to buy a real copy for yourself or for a friend.</p>

<h1>Third Edition Early Release Information</h1>
<p>If you can see this, you are reading an early release of the third edition,
either via www.obeythetestinggoat.com, or via the O’Reilly Learning site.
Congratulations!</p>
<p>At the time of writing, the first 8 chapters have been updated for the third edition. They’ve been upgraded to Python 3.11, Django 4, and the text has been comprehensively reviewed.</p>
<p><em>Chapters 9 and above are still on Python 3.7 / Django 1.x.</em></p>
<p>If you’re following through the code examples in the book,
you have two choices:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Muddle through and try and figure out how to translate the
example code to the new version of Django</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Save all your work, and then use my book example repo
to reset your code to the canonical versions.
This is probably the low risk option, but more boring.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks for reading, and please do send any and all feedback!
At this early release stage, feedback is more important than ever.

<section data-pdf-bookmark="Why I Wrote a Book About Test-Driven Development" data-type="sect1"><div class="sect1" id="id2">
<h1>Why I Wrote a Book About Test-Driven Development</h1>
<p><em>`‘Who are you, why have you written this book, and why should I
read it?’'</em> I hear you ask.</p>
<p><a data-primary="Test-Driven Development (TDD)" data-secondary="need for" data-type="indexterm" id="TDDneed00"/>
I was lucky enough, early on in my career, to fall in with a bunch of TDD fanatics,
and it made such a big impact on my programming that I was burning to share it with everyone.
You might say I had the enthusiasm of a recent convert,
and the learning experience was still a recent memory for me,
so that’s what led to the first edition, back in 2014.</p>
<p>When I first learned Python (from Mark Pilgrim’s excellent <a href="https://diveintopython3.problemsolving.io/"><em>Dive Into Python</em></a>),
I came across the concept of TDD,
and thought “Yes. I can definitely see the sense in that.”
Perhaps you had a similar reaction when you first heard about TDD?
It sounds like a really sensible approach,
a really good habit to get into—​like regularly flossing your teeth.</p>
<p>Then came my first big project,
and you can guess what happened—​there was a client,
there were deadlines, there was lots to do,
and any good intentions about TDD went straight out of the window.</p>
<p>And, actually, it was fine.  I was fine.</p>
<p>At first.</p>
<p>At first I knew I didn’t really need TDD because it was a small website, and I
could easily test whether things worked by just manually checking it out. Click
this link <em>here</em>, choose that drop-down item <em>there</em>, and <em>this</em> should happen.
Easy. This whole writing tests thing sounded like it would have taken <em>ages</em>,
and besides, I fancied myself, from the full height of my three weeks of adult
coding experience, as being a pretty good programmer. I could handle it. Easy.</p>
<p>Then came the fearful goddess Complexity. She soon showed me the limits of my
experience.</p>
<p>The project grew. Parts of the system started to depend on other parts. I did
my best to follow good principles like DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself), but that
just led to some pretty dangerous territory.  Soon I was playing with multiple
inheritance. Class hierarchies eight levels deep. <code>eval</code> statements.</p>
<p>I became scared of making changes to my code.
I was no longer sure what depended on what,
and what might happen if I changed this code <em>over here</em>,
oh gosh, I think that bit over there inherits from it—​no, it doesn’t, it’s overriden.
Oh, but it depends on that class variable.
Right, well, as long as I override the override it should be fine.
I’ll just check—​but checking was getting much harder.
There were lots of sections to the site now,
and clicking through them all manually was starting to get impractical.
Better to leave well enough alone, forget refactoring, just make do.</p>
<p>Soon I had a hideous, ugly mess of code. New development became painful.</p>
<p>Not too long after this, I was lucky enough to get a job with a company called
Resolver Systems (now <a href="https://www.pythonanywhere.com">PythonAnywhere</a>), where
Extreme Programming (XP) was the norm. They introduced me to rigorous TDD.</p>
<p>Although my previous experience had certainly opened my mind to the possible benefits of automated testing,
I still dragged my feet at every stage.
“I mean, testing in general might be a good idea, but <em>really</em>?  All these tests?
Some of them seem like a total waste of time…​
What? Functional tests <em>as well as</em> unit tests?
Come on, that’s overdoing it! And this TDD test/minimal-code-change/test cycle?
 This is just silly! We don’t need all these baby steps!
Come on, we can see what the right answer is, why don’t we just skip to the end?”</p>
<p>Believe me, I second-guessed every rule, I suggested every shortcut,
I demanded justifications for every seemingly pointless aspect of TDD,
and I came out seeing the wisdom of it all.
I’ve lost count of the number of times I’ve thought “Thanks, tests”,
as a functional test uncovers a regression we would never have predicted,
or a unit test saves me from making a really silly logic error.
Psychologically, it’s made development a much less stressful process.
It produces code that’s a pleasure to work with.<a data-primary="" data-startref="TDDneed00" data-type="indexterm" id="id163"/></p>
<p>So, let me tell you <em>all</em> about it!</p>
</div></section>
<section data-pdf-bookmark="Aims of This Book" data-type="sect1"><div class="sect1" id="id127">
<h1>Aims of This Book</h1>
<p>My main aim is to impart a methodology—​a way of doing web development, which
I think makes for better web apps and happier developers. There’s not much
point in a book that just covers material you could find by Googling, so this
book isn’t a guide to Python syntax, or a tutorial on web development <em>per se</em>.
Instead, I hope to teach you how to use TDD to get more reliably to our shared,
holy goal: <em>clean code that works.</em></p>
<p>With that said: I will constantly refer to a real practical example, by
building a web app from scratch using tools like Django, Selenium, jQuery,
and Mocks. I’m not assuming any prior knowledge of any of these, so you
should come out of the other end of this book with a decent introduction to
those tools, as well as the discipline of TDD.</p>
<p>In Extreme Programming we always pair-program, so I’ve imagined writing this
book as if I was pairing with my previous self, having to explain how the
tools work and answer questions about why we code in this particular way. So,
if I ever take a bit of a patronising tone, it’s because I’m not all that
smart, and I have to be very patient with myself. And if I ever sound
defensive, it’s because I’m the kind of annoying person that systematically
disagrees with whatever anyone else says, so sometimes it takes a lot of
justifying to convince myself of anything.</p>
