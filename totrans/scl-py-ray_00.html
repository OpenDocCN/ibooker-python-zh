  <h1>Foreword</h1>
  
  <p>In this book, Holden Karau and Boris Lublinksy touch on the biggest trend in computing today: the growing need for scalable computing. This trend is being driven, in large part, by the proliferation of machine learning (ML) throughout many industries and the growing amount of computational resources needed to do ML in practice.</p>
  <p>The last decade has seen significant shifts in the nature of computing. In 2012, when I first began working in ML, much of it was managed on a single laptop or server, and many practitioners were using Matlab. That year was something of an inflection point as deep learning made a splash by winning the ImageNet competition by an astounding margin. That led to a sustained trend over many years in which more and more computation on more and more data has led to better results. This trend has yet to show signs of slowing down and, if anything, has accelerated in recent years with the advent of large language models.</p>
  <p>This shift—from small models on small data to large models on large data—has changed the practice of ML. Software engineering now plays a central role in ML, and teams and organizations that successfully leverage ML often build large in-house infrastructure teams to support the distributed systems necessary for scaling ML applications across hundreds or thousands of machines.</p>
  <p>So at the same time that ML is growing in its capabilities and becoming more relevant for a variety of businesses, it is also becoming increasingly difficult to do because of the significant infrastructure investment required to do it.</p>
  <p>To get to a state where every business can leverage and get value out of ML, we will have to make it far easier to apply in practice. This will mean eliminating the need for developers to become experts in distributed systems and infrastructure.</p>
  <p>This goal, making scalable computing and scalable ML easy to do, is the purpose of Ray and the reason that we created Ray in the first place. This is a natural continuation of a progression in computing. Going back a handful of decades, there was a time when developers had to program in Assembly Language and other low-level machine languages in order to build applications, and so the best developers were the people who could perform low-level memory optimizations and other manipulations. That made software development difficult to do and limited the number of people who could build applications. Today, very few developers think about Assembly. It is no longer on the critical path for application development, and as a result, far more people can develop applications and build great products today.</p>
  <p>The same thing will happen with infrastructure. Today, building and managing infrastructure for scaling Python applications and scaling ML applications is on the critical path for doing ML and for building scalable applications and products. However, infrastructure will go the way of Assembly Language. When that happens, it will open up the door and far more people will build these kinds of applications.</p>
  <p><em>Scaling Python and Ray</em> can serve as an entry point for anyone looking to do ML in practice or looking to build the next generation of scalable products and applications. It touches on a wide variety of topics, ranging from scaling a variety of important ML patterns, from deep learning to hyperparameter tuning to reinforcement learning. It touches on the best practices for scaling data ingest and preprocessing. It covers the fundamentals of building scalable applications. Importantly, it touches on how Ray fits into the broader ML and computing ecosystem.</p>
  <p>I hope you enjoy reading this book! It will equip you to understand the biggest trend in computing and can equip you with the tools to navigate and leverage that trend as you look to apply ML to your business or build the next great product and application.</p>
