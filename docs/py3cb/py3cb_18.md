[`docs.python.org`](http://docs.python.org)It goes without saying that Python’s own online documentation is an excellent resourceif you need to delve into the finer details of the language and modules. Justmake sure you’re looking at the documentation for Python 3 and not earlier versions.[`www.python.org/dev/peps`](http://www.python.org/dev/peps)Python Enhancement Proposals (PEPs) are invaluable if you want to understandthe motivation for adding new features to the Python language as well as subtleimplementation details. This is especially true for some of the more advanced languagefeatures. In writing this book, the PEPs were often more useful than theofficial documentation.[`pyvideo.org`](http://pyvideo.org)This is a large collection of video presentations and tutorials from past PyCon conferences,user group meetings, and more. It can be an invaluable resource for learningabout modern Python development. Many of the videos feature Python coredevelopers talking about the new features being added in Python 3.[`code.activestate.com/recipes/langs/python`](http://code.activestate.com/recipes/langs/python)The ActiveState Python recipes site has long been a resource for finding the solutionto thousands of specific programming problems. As of this writing, it containsapproximately 300 recipes specific to Python 3\. You’ll find that many of its recipeseither expand upon topics covered in this book or focus on more narrowly definedtasks. As such, it’s a good companion.[`stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/python`](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/python)Stack Overflow currently has more than 175,000 questions tagged as Python-related(and almost 5000 questions specific to Python 3). Although the quality of the questionsand answers varies, there is a lot of good material to be found.
