- en: You’ve laid some web scraping groundwork; now comes the fun part. Until this
    point, your web scrapers have been relatively dumb. They’re unable to retrieve
    information unless it’s immediately presented to them in a nice format by the
    server. They take all information at face value and store it without any analysis.
    They get tripped up by forms, website interaction, and even JavaScript. In short,
    they’re no good for retrieving information unless that information really wants
    to be retrieved.

- en: This part of the book will help you analyze raw data to get the story beneath
    the data—the story that websites often hide beneath layers of JavaScript, login
    forms, and antiscraping measures. You’ll learn how to use web scrapers to test
    your sites, automate processes, and access the internet on a large scale. By the
    end of this section, you will have the tools to gather and manipulate nearly any
    type of data, in any form, across any part of the internet.
