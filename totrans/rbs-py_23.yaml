- en: Welcome to [Part IV](part0025.html#part_4) of the book, which is about the importance
    of building a safety net around your codebase. Think about a tightrope walker
    perilously balanced, high in the air. No matter how many times the performer has
    practiced their routine, there is always a set of safety precautions should the
    worst happen. The tightrope walker can perform their act with confidence, trusting
    in the fact that something will break their fall if they slip. You want to provide
    your fellow collaborators with the same sort of confidence and trust as they work
    in your codebase.

  zh: 欢迎来到本书的[第四部分](part0025.html#part_4)，这部分内容讲述了围绕代码库构建安全网的重要性。想象一下一个在高空中危险地平衡的走钢丝演员。无论表演者练习了多少次他们的表演，都总是会有一套安全措施以防万一。走钢丝的演员可以充满信心地表演，相信如果他们失足，一定会有东西来阻止他们坠落。你希望为你的合作者提供同样的信心和信任，让他们在你的代码库中工作。
- en: Even if your code is completely error free, how long will it stay that way?
    Every change introduces risk. Every new developer coming into a codebase will
    take time before fully understanding all of its intricacies. Customers will change
    their minds and ask for the complete opposite of what they asked for six months
    ago. This is all a natural part of any software development life cycle.

  zh: 即使你的代码完全没有错误，它能保持多久呢？每一次变更都带来风险。每一个新的开发人员进入代码库都需要时间才能完全理解其中的复杂性。客户会改变主意，要求完全与六个月前相反的东西。这都是软件开发生命周期的自然部分。
- en: Your development safety net is a combination of static analysis and tests. Much
    has been written on the topic of testing and how to write good tests. In the chapters
    that follow, I will focus on *why* you write tests, how to decide which tests
    you write, and how you can make those tests more valuable. I’ll go beyond simple
    unit and integration testing to talk about advanced testing techniques like acceptance
    testing, property-based testing, and mutation testing.

  zh: 你的开发安全网是静态分析和测试的结合。关于测试以及如何编写好测试的话题已经有很多文章写过。在接下来的章节中，我将重点介绍*为什么*编写测试，如何决定编写哪些测试，以及如何使这些测试更有价值。我将超越简单的单元测试和集成测试，谈论更高级的测试技术，如验收测试、基于属性的测试和变异测试。
