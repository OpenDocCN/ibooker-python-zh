- en: 'CPython runs on a portable, C-coded virtual machine. Python’s built-in objects—such
    as numbers, sequences, dictionaries, sets, and files—are coded in C, as are several
    modules in Python’s standard library. Modern platforms support dynamically loaded
    libraries, with file extensions such as .*dll* on Windows, .*so* on Linux, and
    .*dylib* on Mac: building Python produces such binary files. You can code your
    own extension modules for Python in C (or any language that can produce C-callable
    libraries), using the Python C API covered in this chapter. With this API, you
    can produce and deploy dynamic libraries that Python scripts and interactive sessions
    can later use with the **import** statement, covered in [“The import Statement”](ch07.xhtml#the_import_statement).'

    access the features the modules supply. *Embedding* Python means executing Python
    code from an application coded in another language. For such execution to be useful,
    Python code must in turn be able to access some of your application’s functionality.
    In practice, therefore, embedding implies some extending, as well as a few embedding-specific
    operations. The three main reasons for wishing to extend Python can be summarized
    as follows:'

    you can find an in-depth [tutorial](https://oreil.ly/BMl4L) and an extensive [reference
    manual](https://oreil.ly/OQXBK). Many details are best studied in Python’s extensively
    documented C sources. Download Python’s source distribution and study the sources
    of Python’s core, C-coded extension modules, and the example extensions supplied
    for this purpose.

- en: Although we include some non-C extension options, to extend or embed Python
    using the C API you must know the C and/or C++ programming languages. We do not
    cover C and C++ in this book, but there are many print and online resources that
    you can consult to learn them. Most of the online content of this chapter assumes
    that you have at least some knowledge of C.
