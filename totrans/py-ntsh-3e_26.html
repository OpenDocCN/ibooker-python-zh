<h1>Planning a Python Version Upgrade</h1>

If you have a stable, running application, and a stable deployment environment, a reasonable decision might be to leave it alone. But version upgrades do come with benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>New versions usually introduce new features, which may allow you to simplify code.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Updated versions include bug fixes and refactorings, which can improve system stability and performance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Security vulnerabilities identified in an older version may be fixed in a new version.<sup><a data-type="noteref" href="ch26.xhtml#ch01fn165" id="ch01fn165-marker">2</a></sup></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Eventually, old Python versions fall out of support, and projects running on older versions become difficult to staff and more costly to maintain. Upgrading might then become a necessity.</p>
<section data-pdf-bookmark="Choosing a Target Version" data-type="sect2"><div class="sect2" id="choosing_a_target_version">
<h2>Choosing a Target Version</h2>
<p>Before deciding which version to migrate to, sometimes you have to figure out first, “What version am I running now?” You may be unpleasantly surprised to find old software running unsupported Python versions lurking in your company’s systems. Often this happens when those systems depend on some third-party package that is itself behind in version upgrades, or does not have an upgrade available. The situation is even more dire when such a system is critical in some way for company operations. You may be able to isolate the lagging package behind a remote-access API, allowing that package to run on the old version while permitting your own code to safely upgrade. The presence of systems with these upgrade constraints must be made visible to senior management, so they can be advised of the risks and trade-offs of retaining, upgrading, isolating, or replacing.</p>
<p>The choice of target version often defaults to “whatever version is the most current.” This is a reasonable choice, as it is usually the most cost-effective option with respect to the investment involved in doing the upgrade: the most recent release will have the longest support period moving forward. A more conservative position might be “whatever version is the most current, minus 1.” You can be reasonably sure that version <em>N</em>–1 has undergone some period of in-production testing at other companies, and someone else has shaken out most of the bugs.</p>
</div></section>
<section data-pdf-bookmark="Scoping the Work" data-type="sect2"><div class="sect2" id="scoping_the_work">
<h2>Scoping the Work</h2>
<p>After you have selected your target version of Python, identify all the breaking changes in the versions after the version your software is currently using, up to and including the target version (see the <a data-type="xref" href="app01.xhtml#new_features_and_changes_in">Appendix</a> for a detailed table of features and breaking changes by version; additional details can be found in the “What’s New in Python 3.<em>n</em>” sections of the <a href="https://oreil.ly/pvEtK">online docs</a>). Breaking changes are usually documented with a compatible form that will work with both your current version and the target version. Document and communicate the source changes that development teams will need to make before upgrading. (There may be significantly more work than expected involved in moving directly to the selected target version, if a lot of your code is affected by breaking changes or compatibility issues with related software. You may even end up revisiting the choice of target version or considering smaller steps. Perhaps you’ll decide on upgrading to <em>target</em>–1 as a first step and deferring the task of the upgrade to <em>target</em> or <em>target</em>+1 for a subsequent upgrade project.)</p>
<p>Identify any third-party or open source libraries that your codebase uses, and ensure that they are compatible with (or have plans to be compatible with) the target Python version. Even if your own codebase is ready for upgrading to the target, an external library that lags behind may hold up your upgrade project. If necessary, you may be able to isolate such a library in a separate runtime environment (using virtual machines or container technologies), if that library offers a remote access programming interface.</p>
<p>Make the target Python version available in development environments, and optionally in deployment environments, so that developers can confirm that their upgrade changes are complete and correct.</p>
</div></section>
<section data-pdf-bookmark="Applying the Code Changes" data-type="sect2"><div class="sect2" id="applying_the_code_changes">
<h2>Applying the Code Changes</h2>
<p>Once you have decided on your target version and identified all the breaking changes, you’ll need to make changes in your codebase to make it compatible with the target version. Your goal, ideally, is to have the code in a form that is compatible with both the current <em>and</em> target Python versions.</p>
<div data-type="tip">
<h1>Imports from __future__</h1>
<p><span class="code">__future__</span> is<a contenteditable="false" data-primary="__future__ module" data-type="indexterm" id="idm44924475451584"/><a contenteditable="false" data-primary="standard library modules" data-secondary="__future__" data-type="indexterm" id="idm44924475450448"/> a standard library module containing a variety of features, documented in the <a href="https://oreil.ly/3NaU5">online docs</a>, to ease migration between versions. It is unlike any other module, because importing features can affect the syntax, not just the semantics, of your program. Such imports <em>must</em> be the initial executable statements of your code.</p>
<p>Each “future feature” is activated using the statement:</p>
<pre data-code-language="python" data-type="programlisting">
<strong><code class="kn">from</code></strong><code> </code><code class="nn">__future__</code><code> </code><strong><code class="kn">import</code></strong><code> </code><em><code class="n">feature</code></em></pre>
<p>where <em><span class="code">feature</span></em> is the name of the feature you want to use.</p>
<p>In the span of versions this book covers, the only future feature you might consider using is:</p>
<pre data-code-language="python" data-type="programlisting">
<strong><code class="kn">from</code></strong><code> </code><code class="nn">__future__</code><code> </code><strong><code class="kn">import</code></strong><code> </code><code class="n">annotations</code></pre>
<p>which permits references to as-yet-undefined types without enclosing them in quotes (as covered in <a data-type="xref" href="ch05.xhtml#type_annotations">Chapter 5</a>). If your current version is Python 3.7 or later, then adding this <span class="code">__future__</span> import will permit use of the unquoted types in type annotations, so you don’t have to redo them later.</p>
</div>
<p>Begin by reviewing libraries that are shared across multiple projects. Removing the blocking changes from these libraries will be a crucial first step, since you will be unable to deploy any dependent applications on the target version until this is done. Once a library is compatible with both versions, it can be deployed for use in the migration project. Moving forward, the library code must maintain compatibility with both the current Python version and the target version: shared libraries will likely be the <em>last</em> projects that will be able to utilize any new features of the target version.</p>
<p>Standalone applications will have earlier opportunities to use the new features in the target version. Once the application has removed all code affected by breaking changes, commit it to your source control system as a cross-version-compatible snapshot. Afterwards, you may add new features to the application code and deploy it into environments that support the target version.</p>
<p>If version compatibility changes affect type annotations, you can use <em>.pyi</em> stub files to isolate version-dependent typing from your source code.</p>

<p>The PSF releases Python on a minor-release-per-year cadence, with each version enjoying five years of support after release. If you apply a latest-release-minus-1 strategy, it provides you with a stable, proven version to migrate to, with a four-year support horizon (in case a future upgrade needs to be deferred).

<p>Maintaining the version currency of the software that your organization’s systems depend on is an ongoing habit of proper “software hygiene,” in Python just like in any other development stack.

These events are the very ones you are trying to avoid, or at least minimize, by implementing a steady and ongoing Python version upgrade program.</p></div></div></section></div></body></html>
