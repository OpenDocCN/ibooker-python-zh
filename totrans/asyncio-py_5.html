<h1><span class="label">Chapter 5. </span>Concluding Thoughts</h1>


<p>When substantial new features appear in Python, they’re new for
everybody.<a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="asyncio" data-secondary="concluding thoughts on" id="idm46363041124888"/> I have nearly two decades’ experience with
Python, but I still found Asyncio difficult to learn—even taking into account that I had already worked with
Twisted and Tornado on previous projects, so event-based
programming was not new to me. I found the <code>asyncio</code> API to be much more
complex than I had expected. Part of this was due to a lack of
high-level documentation.</p>

<p>Now, having spent the time to learn how to use Asyncio in Python, I feel
a lot more comfortable with it, and this progression will likely be
similar for you too. There is a coherent structure and purpose
behind the design of the API, and hopefully this book will make it
much easier for you to learn than it was for me. With a basic
understanding in place, I’m now finding it quite easy to write
new Asyncio-based code without having to constantly refer back to the
docs: this is a very good sign, and certainly isn’t the case with all the
standard library modules.</p>

<p>There are still some rough edges, though. The <code>asyncio</code> standard library will continue to have a large,
fine-grained API, since it caters to both framework designers and
end-user developers. This means that we—as end-user
developers—will have to learn which parts of the API are applicable
to us and which are not. In time, as the third-party library
ecosystem for <code>asyncio</code> grows and matures, we will likely find ourselves working
with those library APIs rather than the raw <code>asyncio</code> standard library
API. Existing libraries like <code>aiohttp</code> and Sanic are good examples
of this. The <code>asyncio</code> API itself will also continue to improve as more people
gain experience with it.</p>

<p>I also made unexpected discoveries along
the way: by happy coincidence, it turned out that I needed to finally learn
ZeroMQ at around the same time this book was being written, and I’m finding that
<code>asyncio</code> in combination with <code>pyzmq</code> makes network programming a joy. My recommendation for the best way to learn Asyncio is to experiment,
try things out and have fun.</p>
