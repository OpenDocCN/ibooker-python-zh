<h1><span class="label">Part III. </span>Making a Website</h1>&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
<p><a data-type="xref" href="part02.html#part2">Part II</a> was a quick tour of FastAPI,&#13;
to get you up to speed quickly.&#13;
This part will go wider and deeper into the details. We’ll build a medium-sized web service&#13;
to access and manage data about cryptids—imaginary creatures—and the equally fictitious explorers who seek them.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>The full service will have three layers,&#13;
as I’ve discussed earlier:</p>&#13;
<dl>&#13;
<dt>Web</dt>&#13;
<dd>&#13;
<p>The web interface</p>&#13;
</dd>&#13;
<dt>Service</dt>&#13;
<dd>&#13;
<p>The business logic</p>&#13;
</dd>&#13;
<dt>Data</dt>&#13;
<dd>&#13;
<p>The precious DNA of the whole thing</p>&#13;
</dd>&#13;
</dl>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Plus the web service will have these cross-layer components:</p>&#13;
<dl>&#13;
<dt>Model</dt>&#13;
<dd>&#13;
<p>Pydantic data definitions</p>&#13;
</dd>&#13;
<dt>Tests</dt>&#13;
<dd>&#13;
<p>Unit, integration, and end-to-end tests</p>&#13;
</dd>&#13;
</dl>&#13;
&#13;
<p class="pagebreak-before">The site design will address the following:</p>&#13;
&#13;
<ul>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p>What belongs inside each layer?</p>&#13;
</li>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p>What is passed between layers?</p>&#13;
</li>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p>Can we change/add/delete code later without breaking anything?</p>&#13;
</li>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p>If something breaks, how do I find and fix it?</p>&#13;
</li>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p>What about security?</p>&#13;
</li>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p>Can the site scale and perform well?</p>&#13;
</li>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p>Can we keep all this as clear and simple as possible?</p>&#13;
</li>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p>Why do I ask so many questions? Why, oh why?</p>&#13;
</li>&#13;
</ul>&#13;
