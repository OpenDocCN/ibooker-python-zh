- en: I’ve tried to write this book with beginners in mind, but if you’re new to programming,
    I’m assuming that you’ve already learned the basics of Python. So if you haven’t
    already, do run through a Python beginner’s tutorial or get an introductory book
    like [*The Quick Python Book*](https://www.manning.com/books/the-quick-python-book-third-edition)
    or [*Think Python*](https://greenteapress.com/thinkpython/html/index.xhtml), or,
    just for fun, [*Invent Your Own Computer Games with Python*](https://inventwithpython.com/#invent),
    all of which are excellent introductions.

    just fine. Python is joyously simple to understand.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book was tested against Python 3.11. If you’re on an earlier version, you
    will find minor differences in the way things look in my command output listings
    (tracebacks won’t have the `^^^^^^` carets marking error locations for example)
    so you’re best off upgrading, ideally, if you can.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you are thinking of using [PythonAnywhere](http://www.pythonanywhere.com)
    rather than a locally installed Python, you should go and take a quick look at
    [Link to Come] before you get started.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In any case, I expect you to have access to Python, to know how to launch it
    from a command line, and to know how to edit a Python file and run it. Again,
    have a look at the three books I recommended previously if you’re in any doubt.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I’m also assuming you have a basic grasp of how the web works—​what HTML is,
    what a POST request is, and so on. If you’re not sure about those, you’ll need
    to find a basic HTML tutorial; there are a few at [*http://www.webplatform.org/*](http://www.webplatform.org/).
    If you can figure out how to create an HTML page on your PC and look at it in
    your browser, and understand what a form is and how it might work, then you’re
    probably OK.

- en: Django
  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The book uses the Django framework, which is (probably) the most well-established
    web framework in the Python world. I’ve written the book assuming that the reader
    has no prior knowledge of Django, but if you’re new to Python *and* new to web
    development *and* new to testing, you may occasionally find that there’s just
    one too many topics and sets of concepts to try and take on board. If that’s the
    case, I recommend taking a break from the book, and taking a look at a Django
    tutorial. [DjangoGirls](https://tutorial.djangogirls.org/) is the best, most beginner-friendly
    tutorial I know of. The [official tutorial](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/intro/tutorial01/)
    is also excellent for more experienced programmers.

    know JavaScript, don’t worry about it until then, and if you find yourself a little
    confused, I’ll recommend a couple of guides at that point.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A Python virtualenv (short for virtual environment) is how you set up your environment
    for different Python projects. It allows you to use different packages (e.g.,
    different versions of Django, and even different versions of Python) in each project.
    And because you’re not installing things system-wide, it means you don’t need
    root permissions.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Whenever you’re working through the book, you’ll want to make sure your virtualenv
    has been “activated”. You can always tell when your virtualenv is active because
    you’ll see `(.venv)` in parentheses, in your prompt. But you can also check by
    running `which python` to check whether Python is currently the system-installed
    one, or the virtualenv one.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The command to activate the virtualenv is `source .venv/Scripts/activate` on
    Windows and `source .venv/bin/activate` on Mac/Linux. The command to deactivate
    is just `deactivate`.

    a specific version of Selenium. It’s because Selenium is constantly being updated
    to keep up with changes in web browsers, and since we can’t really pin our browser
    to a specific version, we’re best off using the latest Selenium. It was version
    4.9 at the time of writing.
