<h1>Preface</h1>


<p>Python 3.4 introduced the <code>asyncio</code> library, and Python 3.5 produced
the <code>async</code> and <code>await</code> keywords to use it palatably. These new
additions allow so-called <em>asynchronous</em> <span class="keep-together">programming.</span></p>

<p>All of these new features, which I’ll refer to under the single name
<em>Asyncio</em>, have been received by the Python community somewhat warily; a segment of the community seems to see them as complex and difficult to understand. This view is
not limited to beginners: several high-profile contributors to the
Python community have expressed doubts about the complexity of the Asyncio
API in Python, and educators in the community have expressed concern
about how best to teach Asyncio to students.</p>

<p>Most people with a few years’ experience with Python have used threads
before, and even if you haven’t, you are still likely to have
experienced <em>blocking</em>. For example, if you’ve written programs
using the wonderful <code>requests</code> library, you will surely have noticed
that your program pauses for a bit while it does <code>requests.get(url)</code>; this
is blocking behavior.</p>

<p>For one-off tasks, this is fine; but if you want to fetch <em>ten
thousand</em> URLs simultaneously, it’s going to be difficult to use
<code>requests</code>. Large-scale concurrency is one big reason to learn and
use Asyncio, but the other big attraction of Asyncio over preemptive
threading is safety: it will be much easier for you to avoid
race condition bugs with Asyncio.</p>

<p>My goal with this book is to give you a basic
understanding of why these new features have been introduced
and how to use them
in your own projects. More specifically, I aim to provide the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>A critical comparison of <code>asyncio</code> and <code>threading</code> for concurrent
network <span class="keep-together">programming</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An understanding of the new <code>async/await</code> language syntax</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A general overview of the new <code>asyncio</code> standard library features
in Python</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Detailed, extended case studies with code, showing how to use a
few of the more popular Asyncio-compatible third-party libraries</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>We’ll begin with a story that illustrates the shift in thinking that
must accompany a transition from threaded to async programming. Then,
we’ll take a look at the changes that were made in the Python language
itself to accommodate async programming. Finally, we’ll
explore some of the ways in which these new features can be used most
effectively.</p>

<p>The new Asyncio features are not going to radically change the way you
write programs. They provide specific tools that make sense only for
specific situations; but in the right situations, <code>asyncio</code>
is exceptionally useful. In this book, we’re going to explore those
situations and how you can best approach them by using the new Asyncio
features.</p>
