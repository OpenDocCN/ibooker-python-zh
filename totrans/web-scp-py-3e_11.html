&#13;
<p>You’ve laid some web scraping groundwork; now comes the fun part. Until this point, your web scrapers have been relatively dumb. They’re unable to retrieve information unless it’s immediately presented to them in a nice format by the server. They take all information at face value and store it without any analysis. They get tripped up by forms, website interaction, and even JavaScript. In short, they’re no good for retrieving information unless that information really wants to be retrieved.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>This part of the book will help you analyze raw data to get the story beneath the <span class="keep-together">data—the</span> story that websites often hide beneath layers of JavaScript, login forms, and antiscraping measures. You’ll learn how to use web scrapers to test your sites, automate processes, and access the internet on a large scale. By the end of this section, you will have the tools to gather and manipulate nearly any type of data, in any form, across any part of the internet.</p>&#13;
