<h1><span class="label">Part II. </span>A FastAPI Tour</h1>&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
<p>The chapters in this part provide a&#13;
thousand-foot view of FastAPI—more like a drone than a spy satellite.&#13;
They cover the basics quickly&#13;
but stay above the water line&#13;
to avoid drowning you in details.&#13;
The chapters are relatively short&#13;
and are meant to provide context for the&#13;
depths of <a data-type="xref" href="part03.html#part3">Part III</a>.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>After you get used to the ideas in this part,&#13;
<a data-type="xref" href="part03.html#part3">Part III</a> zooms into those details.&#13;
That’s where you can do some serious good,&#13;
or damage.&#13;
No judgment; it’s up to you.</p>&#13;
