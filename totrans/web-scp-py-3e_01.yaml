    how to use Python to request information from a web server, how to perform basic
    handling of the server’s response, and how to begin interacting with a website
    in an automated fashion. By the end, you’ll be cruising around the internet with
    ease, building scrapers that can hop from one domain to another, gather information,
    and store that information for later use.'

    payout for relatively little up-front investment. In all likelihood, 90% of web
    scraping projects you’ll encounter will draw on techniques used in just the next
    6 chapters. This section covers what the general (albeit technically savvy) public
    tends to think of when they think of “web scrapers”:'

    in [Part II](part02.html#part-2). Don’t be fooled into thinking that this first
    section isn’t as important as some of the more advanced projects in the second
    half. You will use nearly all the information in the first half of this book on
    a daily basis while writing web scrapers!
