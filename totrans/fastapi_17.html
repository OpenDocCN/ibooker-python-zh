<p>In <a data-type="xref" href="part03.html#part3">Part III</a>, you built a minimal website with some&#13;
basic code.&#13;
Now let’s do something fun with it.&#13;
The following chapters apply FastAPI to common web uses: forms, files, databases, charts and graphics, maps, and games.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>To tie these applications together&#13;
and make them more interesting than the usual&#13;
dry computing book examples,&#13;
we’ll plunder data from an unusual source,&#13;
some of which you’ve already glimpsed:&#13;
imaginary creatures from world folklore&#13;
and the explorers who pursue them.&#13;
There will be yetis, but also more obscure—though no less <span class="keep-together">striking—members.</span></p>&#13;
