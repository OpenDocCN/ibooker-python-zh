- en: This is a pragmatic introduction to FastAPI—a modern Python web framework. It’s
    also a story of how, now and then, the bright and shiny objects that we stumble
    across can turn out to be very useful. A silver bullet is nice to have when you
    encounter a werewolf. (And you will encounter werewolves later in this book.)

    first met Unix and C on a PDP-11 in 1977, I had a feeling that this Unix thing
    might catch on.

    a good source for free software and technical info. And when a web browser called
    Mosaic was distributed on the baby open internet in 1993, I had a feeling that
    this web thing might catch on.

    the usual suspects at the time: PHP, HTML, and Perl. On a contract job a few years
    later, I finally experimented with Python and was surprised at how quickly I was
    able to access, manipulate, and display data. In my spare time over two weeks,
    I was able to replicate most of a C application that had taken four developers
    a year to write. Now I had a feeling that this Python thing might catch on.'

- en: 'After that, most of my work involved Python and its web frameworks, mostly
    Flask and Django. I particularly liked the simplicity of Flask and preferred it
    for many jobs. But just a few years ago, I spied something glinting in the underbrush:
    a new Python web framework called FastAPI, written by Sebastián Ramírez.'

    impressed by the design and thought that had gone into it. In particular, his
    [history](https://oreil.ly/Ds-xM) page showed how much care he had taken evaluating
    alternatives. This was not an ego project or a fun experiment, but a serious framework
    for real-world development. Now I had a feeling that this FastAPI thing might
    catch on.

- en: I wrote a biomedical API site with FastAPI, and it went so well that a team
    of us rewrote our old core API with FastAPI in the next year. This is still in
    production and has held up well. Our group learned the basics that you’ll read
    in this book, and all felt that we were writing better code, faster, with fewer
    bugs. And by the way, some of us had not written in Python before, and only I
    had used FastAPI.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So when I had an opportunity to suggest a follow-up to my *Introducing Python*
    book to O’Reilly, FastAPI was at the top of my list. In my opinion, FastAPI will
    have at least the impact that Flask and Django have had, and maybe more.

- en: 'As I’ve mentioned, the FastAPI website itself provides world-class documentation,
    including many details on the usual web topics: databases, authentication, deployment,
    and so on. So why write a book?'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book isn’t meant to be exhaustive because, well, that’s exhausting. It
    *is* meant to be useful—to help you quickly pick up the main ideas of FastAPI
    and apply them. I will point out various techniques that required some sleuthing
    and offer advice on day-to-day best practices.

    what I just promised, offering details and random asides. Finally, there’s a brief
    digestible Review.

    experience will be unique, but I hope that you will find enough of value here
    to become a more productive web developer.
