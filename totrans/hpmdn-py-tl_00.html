<h1>Preface</h1>


<p>This book is a guide to modern Python developer tools—​the programs that help
you perform tasks such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Managing Python installations on your system</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Installing third-party packages for your current project</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Building a Python package for distribution on a package repository</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Running a test suite repeatedly across multiple environments</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Linting and type-checking your code to catch bugs</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>You don’t strictly need these tools to write Python software. Fire up your
system’s Python interpreter and get an interactive prompt. Save your Python code
as a script for later. Why use anything beyond an editor and a shell?</p>

<p>This is not a rhetorical question. Every tool you add to your development
workflow should have a clear purpose and bring benefits that outweigh the costs
of using it. Generally, the benefits of development tooling become manifest when
you need to make development sustainable <em>over time</em>. At some point, publishing
your module on the Python Package Index will be easier than emailing it to your
users.</p>

<p>Somewhere along the journey from writing one-off scripts to distributing and
maintaining packages, challenges pop up:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Supporting multiple versions of Python on multiple operating systems</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Keeping dependencies up-to-date, and scanning them for vulnerabilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Keeping the code base readable and consistent</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Interacting with bug reports and external contributions from the community</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Keeping test coverage high to reduce the defect rate in code changes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Automating repeated tasks to reduce friction and avoid surprises</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>This book will show you how developer tooling can help with such challenges. The
tools described here greatly benefit the code quality, security, and
maintainability of Python projects.</p>

<p>But tooling also adds complexity and overhead. The book strives to minimize that
by forging tools into an easy-to-use toolchain, and by automating workflows
reliably and repeatably—​whether they execute locally on a developer machine, or
on a continuous integration server across a range of platforms and environments.
As much as possible, you should be able to focus your attention on writing
software, with your toolchain working in the background.</p>

<p>Laziness has been called “a programmer’s greatest virtue,”<sup><a data-type="noteref" id="id231-marker" href="preface01.html#id231">1</a></sup> and this saying applies to development
tooling, too: Keep your workflow simple and don’t adopt tools for their own
sake. At the same time, good programmers are also curious. Give the tools in
this book a try to see what value they may bring to your projects.</p>






<section data-type="sect1" data-pdf-bookmark="Who Should Read This Book?"><div class="sect1" id="id38">
<h1>Who Should Read This Book?</h1>

<p>If you’re one of these people, you’ll benefit from reading this book:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>You’re proficient with Python, but you’re not sure how to create a package.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You’ve been doing this for years—​setuptools, virtualenv, and pip are your
friends. You’re curious about recent developments in tooling and what they
bring to the table.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You maintain mission-critical code that runs in production. But there must be
a better way to do all of this. You want to learn about state-of-the art tools
and evolving best practices.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You want to be more productive as a Python developer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You’re an open source maintainer looking for a robust and modern project
infrastructure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You’re using a bunch of Python tools in your projects, but it’s hard to see
how everything fits together. You want to reduce the friction that comes with
all this tooling.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“Things just keep breaking—​why doesn’t Python find my module now? Why can’t I
import the package I just installed?”</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>This book assumes that you have a basic knowledge of the Python programming
language. The only tooling you need to be familiar with are the Python
interpreter, an editor or IDE, and the command line of your operating system.</p>

<h1>References and Further Reading</h1>

<p>Your first point of reference outside this book should be the official
documentation of each tool. Besides those, many interesting packaging-related
discussions take place on the <a href="https://discuss.python.org/">Python Discourse</a>.
Discussions in the Packaging category are often the place where the future of
the Python packaging and tooling ecosystem is shaped, in the form of packaging
standards using the <a href="https://peps.python.org/">Python Enhancement Proposal</a> (PEP)
process. Finally, the <a href="https://pypa.io/">Python Packaging Authority</a> (PyPA) is a
working group that maintains a core set of software projects used in Python
packaging. Their website tracks the list of currently active interoperability
standards governing Python packaging. The PyPA also publishes the
<a href="https://packaging.python.org/">Python Packaging User Guide</a>.</p>

<section data-type="sect1" data-pdf-bookmark="Acknowledgments"><div class="sect1" id="id45">
<h1>Acknowledgments</h1>

<p>This book covers many open source Python projects. I am very grateful to their
authors and maintainers, most of whom work on them in their free time, often
over many years. In particular, I would like to acknowledge the unsung heroes of
the PyPA, whose work on packaging standards lets the ecosystem evolve towards
better tooling. Special thanks to Thea Flowers for writing Nox and building a
welcoming community.</p>

<p>Before this book, there was the Hypermodern Python article series. I would like
to thank Brian Okken, Michael Kennedy, and Paul Everitt for spreading the word,
and Brian for giving me the courage to turn it into a book.</p>

<p>For their deep insights and opinionated feedback, I am indebted to my reviewers
Pat Viafore, Jürgen Gmach, Hynek Schlawack, William Jamir Silva, Ganesh Hark,
and Karandeep Johar. This book wouldn’t be the same without them. I take
responsibility for any errors that remain.</p>

<p>Making a book takes a village. I would like to thank my editors Zan McQuade,
Brian Guerin, Sarah Grey, and Greg Hyman, as well as all the team at O’Reilly.
My special thanks go out to Sarah for keeping me on track and improving my
writing during this journey. For giving me time to work on this book, I thank
Jakub Borys, my manager at Cloudflare.</p>

<p>This book is dedicated to Marianna, the love of my life. Without her support,
encouragement, and inspiration, I couldn’t have written this book.</p>
