- en: “Wordle” is an online word game where the objective is to guess a five-letter
    word in six or fewer attempts. Each attempt has to be recognized as a word, not
    including proper nouns. After each attempt, you get information about which of
    the letters you guessed appear in the target word, and which ones are in the correct
    position.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For example, suppose the target word is `MOWER` and you guess `TRIED`. You would
    learn that `E` is in the word and in the correct position, `R` is in the word
    but not in the correct position, and `T`, `I`, and `D` are not in the word.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As a different example, suppose you have guessed the words `SPADE` and `CLERK`,
    and you’ve learned that `E` is in the word, but not in either of those positions,
    and none of the other letters appear in the word. Of the words in the word list,
    how many could be the target word? Write a function called `check_word` that takes
    a five-letter word and checks whether it could be the target word, given these
    guesses.

    that contain the word `pale` in any form, including `pale`, `pales`, `paled`,
    and `paleness`, as well as the related word `pallor`. Use a single regular expression
    that matches any of these words. As an additional challenge, make sure that it
    doesn’t match any other words, like `impale` – you might want to ask a virtual
    assistant for help.
