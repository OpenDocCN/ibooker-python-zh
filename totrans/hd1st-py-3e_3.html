<p><strong>The more code you write, the better you get. It’s that simple.</strong> In this chapter, you continue to create Python code to help the Coach. You learn how to <strong>read</strong> data from a Coach-supplied data <strong>file</strong>, slurping its lines into a <strong>list</strong>, one of Python’s most-powerful built-in <strong>data structures</strong>. As well as creating lists from the file’s data, you’ll also learn how to create lists from scratch, <strong>growing</strong> your list <strong>dynamically</strong> as needs be. And you’ll process lists using one of Python’s most popular looping constructs: the <strong>for</strong> loop. You’ll <strong>convert</strong> values from one data format to another, and you’ll even make a new best friend (your very own Python <strong>BFF</strong>). You’ve had your fill of coffee and pie, so it’s time to roll up your sleeves and get back to work.</p>

<p>With Task #1 complete, it’s time to move onto Task #2. There’s a bit of work to do but, as with the previous chapter’s activities, you can approach things bit-by-bit as detailed in the last chapter:</p>

<p><strong>It’s time to get to work.</strong></p>
<p>You won’t be done by the time the Coach is finished his warm-up, but you’ll definitely make progress by the end of today’s swim session.</p>
<p>Let’s get started by grabbing a copy of this chapter’s data before learning how Python reads data from a file.</p>

<h1>Grab a copy of the Coach’s data</h1>
<p>There’s no point learning how to read data from a file if you have no data to work with. So, head on over to this book’s support website and grab the latest copy of the Coach’s data files. There are 61 individual data files packaged as a ZIP archive. Grab a copy from here::</p>

<p>Once your download completes, unzip the file then copy the resulting swimdata folder into your <code>Learning</code> folder. This ensures the code which follows can find the data as it’ll be in a known place.</p>
<p>Each file in the <code>swimdata</code> folder contains the recorded times for one swimmer’s attempts at a specific youth distance/stroke pairing. Recall the data file from the start of the previous chapter which shows Darius’s under-13 times for the 100m fly:</p>

<h6/>
</div></figure>
<p><strong>Yes, it does.</strong></p>
<p>There’s a BIF called <strong>open</strong> which can work with files, opening them for reading, writing, appending, or any combination of the above.</p>
<p>The <strong>open</strong> BIF is powerful on it’s own, but it shines when combined with Python’s… em, eh… <strong>with</strong> statement.</p>
</div></section>
<section data-pdf-bookmark="The open BIF works with files" data-type="sect1"><div class="sect1" id="the_open_bif_works_with_files">
<h1>The open BIF works with files</h1>
<p>Whether your file contains textual or binary data, the <strong>open</strong> BIF can open the file to read, write, or append data to/from it. By default, <strong>open</strong> reads from a text file, which is perfect as that’s what you want to do with the Darius’s data file.</p>
<figure class="informal"><div class="figure">
<img alt="Image" height="128" src="assets/ch02-4-01.png" width="112"/>
<h6/>
</div></figure>
<p>You can call <strong>open</strong> directly in your code, opening a named file, processing its data, then closing the file when you’re done. This open-process-close pattern is very common, regardless of the programming language you use. In fact, Python has a language statement which makes working with the open-process-close pattern especially convenient: the <strong>with</strong> statement.</p>
<p>Although there’s a bit more to the <strong>with</strong> statement than initially meets the eye, there’s only one thing that you need to know about it right now: If you open your file with <strong>with</strong>, Python arranges to <em>automatically</em> close your file when you’re done, regardless of what happens during whatever processing you perform on the file.</p>

<h6/>
</div></figure>
<p>Let’s see the <strong>with</strong> statement together with the <strong>open</strong> BIF at work, so you can get in on the action.</p>
<p>For the code that follows to work, the assumption is you’ve already downloaded the Coach’s data, unzipping the file into a folder called <code>swimdata</code> within your <code>Learning</code> folder. Do that now if you forgot (and skip back two pages for the URL to use).</p>
<p>To get going, create another new notebook in VS Code, and give it the name <code>Average.ipynb</code>, saving this latest notebook in your <code>Learning</code> folder.</p>
<p>To identify the file you plan to work with you need two things: the file’s name and the location it’s to be found in. Here’s how Python programmers would define constants for these values:</p>
<figure class="informal"><div class="figure">
<img alt="Image" height="210" src="assets/ch02-5-02.png" width="718"/>
<h6/>
</div></figure>
<p>Although referred to as “constants”, Python doesn’t support the notion of constant values, so it’s a convention within the Python programming community to use UPPERCASE variable names to signal to other programmers that the values are constant (and should not be changed). And, yes, eagle-eyed readers will have spotted that we – rather blatantly – disregarded (!!) this convention in the previous chapter with “<code>fn</code>”. This is a <em>shocking</em> use of a lowercase variable name when an uppercase constant name should’ve been used. We got away with this because Python doesn’t enforce this naming convention, as it’s not a language rule. That said, from now on, we’ll be sure to follow it.</p>
<p>With your constants defined, here’s the Python code which opens the file, reads all its data into a list called (exploiting unprecedented imagination here) <code>data</code>, then automatically closes the file:</p>

<h1>Not much code, but there’s lots happening...</h1>
<p>The code is not very long, but – as the annotations at the bottom of the last page indicate – there’s a lot going on:</p>
<figure class="informal"><div class="figure">
<img alt="Image" height="140" src="assets/ch02-6-01.png" width="697"/>
<h6/>
</div></figure>
<p>Let’s highlight three important take-aways:</p>
<p><span class="inlineimage"><img alt="Images" height="20" src="assets/1-circle.png" width="20"/></span> <strong>The with statement opens the file</strong> <em>before</em> <strong>its code block runs.</strong></p>
<p>You may well be asking “Which code block?”, and you’d be right to. We haven’t told you yet, but the <strong>with</strong> statement’s code block is all the code indented under it. In this case, the code block is only one line long and that’s OK (code blocks can be of any length).</p>
<div data-type="note" epub:type="note"><h6>Note</h6>
<p><span style="color:#636466"><strong>If you are coming to Python from one of those programming languages which uses curly-braces to delimit blocks of code, using indentation in this way may unnerve you. Don’t let it, as it’s really not that big a deal.</strong></span></p>
</div>
<figure class="informal"><div class="figure">
<img alt="Image" height="427" src="assets/ch02-6-02.png" width="705"/>
<h6/>
</div></figure>
<p><strong>It not that we don’t want to talk about indentation.</strong></p>
<p>It’s just we feel there’s much more to Python than its use of indentation (or, more correctly, <em>whitespace</em>) to delimit code blocks. Yes, it’s an important aspect of the language, but it’s something most Python newbies get used to quickly. When we need to, we’ll call it out, otherwise we’ll just get on with things. And with that said, let’s get back to the take-aways.</p>
<p><span class="inlineimage"><img alt="Images" height="20" src="assets/2-circle.png" width="20"/></span> <strong>The with statement closes the file</strong> <em>after</em> <strong>its code block runs.</strong></p>
<p>This is a cool feature, as we’d forgotten to do this. It’s nice to know the <strong>with</strong> statement has your back, tidying up after your code block executes.</p>
<p><span class="inlineimage"><img alt="Images" height="20" src="assets/3-circle.png" width="20"/></span> <strong>Two variables are created by the code:</strong> <code>df</code> <strong>and</strong> <code>data</code><strong>.</strong></p>
<p>The <code>df</code> variable refers to a <em>file object</em> created by the successful execution of the <strong>open</strong> BIF. The <code>data</code> variable refers to the list of lines read from the <code>df</code> file object by the <strong>readlines</strong> method. Both variables continue to exist after the code block ends, although the <code>df</code> variable now refers to a <em>closed</em> file object.</p>
</div></section>
<section data-pdf-bookmark="Variables are created dynamically, as needed" data-type="sect1"><div class="sect1" id="variables_are_created_dynamicallycomma_a">
<h1>Variables are created dynamically, as needed</h1>
<p>The <code>df</code> and <code>data</code> variables were created as a result of assignment. Although it’s easy to see how <code>data</code> came into being, thanks to the use of the assignment operator (<code>=</code>), it’s less clear what’s going on with <code>df</code>.</p>
<figure class="informal"><div class="figure">
<img alt="Image" height="494" src="assets/ch02-7-01.png" width="789"/>
<h6/>
</div></figure>
<p><strong>The key word is “as”.</strong></p>
<p>Thanks to that <strong>with</strong>, the <strong>as</strong> keyword takes the <strong>open</strong> BIF’s return value and assigns it to the identified variable name, which is <code>df</code> in your code. It’s as if this code ran:</p>
<pre data-type="programlisting">df = open(FOLDER+FN)</pre>
<p>The <strong>as</strong> keyword, together with <strong>with</strong>, does the same thing (and looks nicer, too).</p>
<p>Let’s take a closer look at what <code>df</code> is, as well as learn a bit about what it can do:</p>

<h1>It’s not that file objects aren’t exciting...</h1>
<p>It’s just, in this case, the file object is merely a means to an end: loading the file’s lines into the <code>data</code> variable. So, what’s <code>data</code> and what can you do with it?</p>

<p>You already know (from the previous chapter) that Python lists understand the square bracket notation. Before you get to that, let’s take a look at what <code>data</code> contains:</p>

<p><strong>Yes, with some help from “with”.</strong></p>
<p>Despite being a one-line code block, a lot’s happening here.</p>
<p>Not only has your list been created, assigned to your <code>data</code> variable <em>and</em> populated with the data contained within the swimmer’s file, but that <code>with</code> statement has managed to complete the first two subtasks for Task #2. How <em>cool</em> is that?</p>
<p>Take a look (on the next page).</p>

<figure class="informal"><div class="figure">

</div></figure>
<p>The third sub-task should not be hard for anyone who has spent any amount of time working with Python’s string technology. As luck would have it, you’ve just worked through the string material in the previous chapter, so you’re all set to have a go. But before you get to that sub-task, we need to talk a little about one specific part of that <strong>with</strong> statement: the <strong>colon</strong>.</p>
</div></section>
<section data-pdf-bookmark="Your new best friend, Python’s colon" data-type="sect1"><div class="sect1" id="your_new_best_friendcomma_pythonapostrop">
<h1>Your new best friend, Python’s colon</h1>
<p>The colon (<code><strong>:</strong></code>) indicates a code block is about to <em>begin</em>.</p>
<p>Unlike a lot of other programming languages, Python does not use curly braces (<code><strong>{</strong></code> and <code><strong>}</strong></code>) to delimit blocks. Instead Python uses <strong>indentation</strong> (or, to be more accurate, <em>whitespace</em>). In fact, in Python, curly braces delimited data, <em>not</em> code.</p>
<p>A code block in Python ends when the indentation ends.</p>
<p>In your <strong>with</strong> statement, the block contains only one line of code, but it could potentially contain any number of lines of code. Code indented to the same level as the immediately preceding line of code belongs to the <em>same</em> block.</p>
<p>The use of the colon is critical here (which is why it’s your new best friend). Like in real life, if you forget your best friend, bad things happen. If you forget the colon at the end of that line, Python refuses to run your code!</p>
<p>Think of the colon and indentation as <em>going together</em>: you can’t have one without the other.</p>

<p><strong>FYI: the Python docs refer to a “code block” as a “suite”.</strong></p>

<p><em>Python’s use of indented whitespace is an important visual clue that a new block of code is starting. However, indentation without the colon confuses Python, so the colon is required at the end of the line of code immediately preceding the block.</em></p>
<p><em>Think of the use of the colon as your way of confirming to Python that the next line is the start of a new block, which is also indented (of course).</em></p>

<h1>there are no Dumb Questions</h1>
<p><span style="color:#412986"><strong>Q:</strong></span> <strong>When it comes to blocks of code within blocks of code, do I just need to increase the level of indentation?</strong></p>
<p><span style="color:#412986"><strong>A:</strong></span> Yes. If you are used to using curly braces to indicate the start and end of a block of code, you have likely had a need to embed a block of code within another block of code, ending up with curly braces <em>inside</em> curly braces. It’s the same thing with Python, except the level of indentation increases. Visually, it is easy to work out where the block of code starts and ends. It starts on the line right after the colon, and it ends with the block’s indentation ends. For an example, recall the short example of a nested <strong>for</strong> loop from <a data-type="xref" href="ch01.xhtml#why_pythonquestion_mark_similar_but_diff">Chapter 1</a>.</p>
<p><span style="color:#412986"><strong>Q:</strong></span> <strong>Is there a standard indentation spacing value? Do most people use four spaces to indicate indentation, or can two spaces be used? Does it matter?</strong></p>
<p><span style="color:#412986"><strong>A:</strong></span> To be honest, it doesn’t really matter whether you use four spaces, two spaces, or any number of spaces to indicate indentation. The tab character can also be used. What does matter is that whatever you do, your usage needs to be <strong>consistent</strong>. If you use four spaces on one line of code, you can’t use two spaces on the next, nor can you mix’n’match spaces with the tab character. The Python parser gets confused when you do mix’n’match and raises an <span style="color:#d90000"><strong>IndentationError</strong></span> or <span style="color:#d90000"><strong>TabError</strong></span>. Note: if you <em>consistently</em> use four spaces, two spaces, or the tab character to indicate your level of indentation, you’ll never see either of those errors.</p>
<p>Now, having said all that, there is a <em>convention</em> in the Python programming community which strongly suggests using four spaces consistently to indent your code. Many Python programmers configure their text editors to automatically replace a press of the tab key with four spaces. Also, be warned: if you are sharing code with other Python programmers and you haven’t used four spaces to consistently indent your code, you better be ready to explain why.</p>
<p>Consistency is good.</p>
<p>You may not have noticed, but VS Code consistently uses four spaces to indent your Python code, automatically indenting to the correct level whenever you indicate a new block is about to begin by correctly putting a colon at the end of the line.</p>

<p>If you go ahead and try both of these <code>with</code> statements in your notebook you’ll learn that both populate the list <code>times</code> refers to with the same collection of strings. So, why not use the two-line version of the code as opposed to the three-line version? After all, just like with the <code>parts</code> list in the previous chapter, the <code>data</code> list is no longer needed once it’s been used that one time...</p>

<p><strong>No, it’s not hard to read. It’s a nightmare.</strong></p>
<p>Three methods are chained here, with the first one creating a list, from which you take the first slot’s data (using the square bracket notation), then you strip it before splitting it... but, what does “it” refer to again?!?</p>
<p>This single line of code is hard to read, understand, explain, <em>and</em> maintain. We pity the poor programmer asked to “fix” this code at some point in the future (who, most likely, will be <em>you</em>).</p>

<h1>Converting a time string into a time value</h1>
<p>After the code from the previous page runs, the <code>times</code> variable refers to a list of strings:</p>

<h6/>
</div></figure>
<p>The values in each of the slots in the <code>times</code> list certainly look like swim times, but they are not. They are strings. To perform any numeric calculation on this list, such as working out an average, these strings need to be converted into numeric values.</p>
<p>Let’s take a closer look at just on value (the first). If you can come up with a strategy for converting this first time, you can then apply it to the rest of the list.</p>

<h1>Convert the times to hundredths of seconds</h1>
<p>At the moment, all the swim times are <em>strings</em> even though our brains see them as <em>times</em>. Not so for our computers, though (let alone Python). Our digital buddies need a little help with the conversion, and here’s how we’d suggest it can be done:</p>
<figure class="informal"><div class="figure">
<img alt="Image" height="878" src="assets/ch02-18-01.png" width="961"/>
<h6/>
</div></figure>
<p>Turning this conversion strategy into Python code is <em>remarkably</em> straightforward. Let’s take a look.</p>
</div></section>
<section data-pdf-bookmark="To hundredths of seconds with Python" data-type="sect1"><div class="sect1" id="to_hundredths_of_seconds_with_python">
<h1>To hundredths of seconds with Python</h1>
<p>We went all out with that visual on the previous page, and converting the visual’s steps to Python code is a near one-for-one match. The code shown below performs the calculation for the first swim time taken from your <code>times</code> list, with the code typed into a single cell in the <code>Average.ipynb</code> notebook.</p>
<figure class="informal"><div class="figure">
<img alt="Image" height="364" src="assets/ch02-19-01.png" width="240"/>

</div></figure>
<p>To help keep you straight, we’ve added some comments to this code. When Python sees the <code>#</code> character, it <em>ignores</em> everything which follows the <code>#</code> until the end of the current line. (Note how VS Code helpfully displays the comments in <span style="color:#40AE49"><strong>green</strong></span>).</p>
<p>Type this code into your notebook, and don’t feel guilty if you decide to exclude the comments (don’t worry, we won’t tell). We put them in to match up the code with the conversion steps from the preview page’s visual.</p>

<p><strong>If you can convert one swim time...</strong></p>
<p>You can convert them all. And, there’s no extra credit for guessing you need a loop here.</p>
<p>Like most programming languages, Python provides many ways to loop, with the <strong>for</strong> loop being a favorite. Let’s look at a simple loop which takes each of the strings from the <code>times</code> list and displays them on screen.</p>

</div></figure>
<p><strong>Cool, isn’t it?</strong></p>
<p>The <strong>for</strong> loop is smart enough to know all about the length of the list it is processing.</p>
<p>There’s always a temptation to use the <strong>len</strong> BIF to work out how big your list is before it’s looped over, but with <strong>for</strong> this is an unnecessary step. The <strong>for</strong> loop starts with the first value in the list, takes each value in order, processes the value, then moves onto the next. When the list is exhausted, the <strong>for</strong> loop terminates.</p>
<p>This is the sort of magic we love.</p>

<p><span style="color:#412986"><strong>A:</strong></span> Good question, and the answer is: <em>maybe</em>. The PSL (the <em>Python Standard Library</em>) includes two modules which might help: <code>time</code> and <code>datetime</code>. To be honest, our eyes started to glaze over while scanning through the copious amount of documentation included with both modules (especially with <code>datetime</code>). Although there might be sokme functionality in either module which might help, we felt that the custom conversion required for the Coach’s timing data is the right fit for now. We reserve the right, of course, to change our mind on this should our date manipulations become a thorny mess sometime down the road...</p>

<p><strong>Python does indeed support while.</strong></p>
<p>But, the <strong>while</strong> loop in Python is used much less than an equivalent <strong>for</strong>.</p>
<p>Before getting to our solution code for the above exercise, let’s take a moment to compare <strong>for</strong> loops against <strong>while</strong> loops.</p>

It’s not that <strong>while</strong> loops shouldn’t be used, just remember to reach for the <strong>for</strong> loop <em>first</em> in most cases.</p>

<h1>Let’s keep a copy of the conversions</h1>
<p>To be honest, <em>either</em> of the two approaches from the bottom of the last page would work for the first part of sub-task (e) of Task #2: <em>Calculate the average time</em>. However, we’re guessing those converted values will be needed at least once more, so best if we put them in another list as we perform the conversions.</p>
<p>To do this, you need to learn a bit more about lists. Specifically, how to create a new, empty list, and how to incrementally add data values to your list as you iterate over the <code>times</code> list.</p>

<p><strong>No, you do not need to worry.</strong></p>
<p>In the previous chapter, we made a big deal about lists in Python being <em>like</em> arrays in other programming languages. This let us introduce the use of the square bracket notation with lists, which is a common technique when working with arrays <em>and</em> lists.</p>
<p>However, <em>unlike</em> with arrays, where you typically have to say how big your array is likely to get (e.g., 1000 slots) and what type of data it’s going to contain (e.g., integers), there’s no need to declare either of these with your Python lists.</p>
<p>Python lists are <em>dynamic</em>, which means they grow as needed (so there’s no need to pre-declare the number of slots beforehand). And Python lists don’t contain data values, they contain <strong>object references</strong>, so you can put any data of any type in a Python list. You can even mix’n’match types.</p>

<h1>It’s time to calculate the average</h1>
<p>You don’t need to be a programmer to know how to calculate an average when given a list of numbers. The code is not difficult, but this fact alone does not justify your decision to actually write it. When you happen upon a coding need which feels like someone else may have already coded it, ask yourself this question: <em>I wonder if there’s anything in the Python Standard Library which might help?</em></p>
<p>There is no shame in reusing existing code, even for something you consider <em>simple</em>. With that in mind, here’s how to calculate the average from the <code>converts</code> list with some help from the PSL:</p>

<p>Although calculating the average is easy, as shown above you haven’t had to write a loop, maintain a count, keep a running total, nor perform the average calculation. All you do is pass the name of the list of numbers into the <strong>mean</strong> function which returns the arithmetic mean (i.e., the average) of your data. Cool. That’ll do.</p>

<p><strong>Yes, and it’s easier than you think.</strong></p>
<p>You could go off and learn how to write automated tests in Python, then code-up any number of tests to check your calculations...</p>
<p>Or you could simply take another look at the swim coach’s spreadsheet to confirm your calculated swim time of ‘<code>1:26.58</code>’ matches the average as calculated by the Coach’s spreadsheet.</p>
<p>And it does, as shown below.</p>

<p>Congratulations! You are finally able to place a well-deserved tick against sub-task (e).</p>
<p>All that remains is to combine the code from the previous chapter with the code seen so far in this chapter. Once that’s done, sub-task (f) will be done too:</p>

<p>At this stage, you should have a number of Jupyter notebooks in your <code>Learning</code> folder. To complete this exercise, you’ll need to study the code in two of them: <code>Darius.ipynb</code> and <code>Average.ipynb</code>.</p>
<p>Create a new notebook, called <code>Times.ipynb</code>, which contains the Python code you need to execute to complete sub-task (f) above. All the code you need already exists, and all you’re doing here is copying the relevant code from your two existing notebooks into your new one.</p>
<p>Be sure to execute all the code in your new notebook to confirm it executes as expected.</p>
<p>Take your time with this exercise then, when you’re ready, flip the page to see our <code>Times.ipynb</code> in action.</p>

<p><strong>No, we haven’t forgotten.</strong></p>
<p>The next chapter lays the groundwork for getting to the point where you can tackle the charting requirement, so we’ve ask the Coach to bear with us.</p>
<p>At the moment, your code only works with the data for one specific data file. There are another 60+ files in the Coach’s dataset. It would be nice if there was a way to use this code with <em>any</em> of them on demand, and as needed.</p>
<p>Doing so is something you can mull over on your way to the next chapter when we’ll work through a solution to this problem <em>together</em>.</p>
<p>For now, let’s conclude this chapter with another summary and a super-topical crossword puzzle. Enjoy!</p>

<h1>Chapter Review Bullet Points</h1>
<ul>
<li><p>Python has no real notion of a <strong>constant</strong> value, so a programming <em>convention</em> has emerged whereby constants are assigned to UPPERCASE variable names.</p></li>
<li><p>The <strong>with</strong> statement is used to manage the context within which its block of code runs.</p></li>
<li><p>When used with the <strong>open</strong> BIF, the <strong>with</strong> statement <em>automatically</em> arranges to close any still opened file once the <strong>with</strong>’s block of code terminates.</p></li>
<li><p>Additionally, the <strong>with</strong> statement assigns the opened file to a <strong>file object</strong> which is used as shorthand for the opened file.</p></li>
<li><p>The file object has lots of methods built-in, including <strong>readlines</strong> which... emm, eh... reads lines. The lines are returned as a <strong>list</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>The rest of the file object methods can be displayed with the <strong>print dir</strong> combo mambo.</p></li>
<li><p>By default, the <strong>open</strong> BIF opens a named file for reading. The file is assumed to contain <strong>textual data</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>The colon, in addition to being your <strong>BFF</strong>, indicates to Python that an <strong>indented</strong> block is about to start on the very next line of code.</p></li>
<li><p>The <strong>.strip().split()</strong> chain is very popular. It used in lots of places, by lots of Python programmers.</p></li>
<li><p>Python has all the usual <strong>operators</strong> (e,g., <code>+</code>, <code>-</code>, <code>*</code>, <code>/</code>), and then some (e.g., <code>//</code> and <code>:=</code>).</p></li>
<li><p>The <code>//</code> operator performs <strong>floor division</strong> which ensures, among other things, that the result of the division is always a whole number.</p></li>
<li><p>Although you are well within your rights to <em>love</em> the <strong>for</strong> and <strong>while</strong> loops equally, the <strong>for</strong> loop sees a lot more use in the community, and it’s typically reached for <em>first</em> whenever a Python programmer needs to iterate.</p></li>
<li><p>Python’s <strong>list</strong> is a very popular built-in data structure, which understands the familiar square bracket notation.</p></li>
<li><p>An empty list looks like this: <code>[]</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Items in a list are enclosed in <strong>square brackets</strong> and separated from each other by a <strong>comma.</strong> Knowing this, lists easy to spot.</p></li>
<li><p>Lists come with lots of built-in functionality, but the <em>star of this show</em> (in that chapter) is the <strong>append</strong> method.</p></li>
<li><p>The <strong>int</strong> BIF converts its single argument to an integer, if it can. The value <code>"42"</code> converts without issue, whereas <code>"forty-two"</code> sends <strong>int</strong> into meltdown.</p></li>
<li><p>The <strong>PSL</strong> (not the coffee!!) provides the <code>statistics</code> module which, among other things, provides a handy <strong>mean</strong> function. The <strong>mean</strong> function has everything to do with calculating averages, as opposed to not being nice to be around...</p></li>
<li><p>The <strong>round</strong> BIF gets rid of unwanted decimal places.</p></li>
<li><p>The <strong>str</strong> BIF converts its argument to a string.</p></li>
<li><p>The Coach is really <strong>happy</strong> with your progress to date, as should you be. There’s a lot of <strong>good work</strong> in this chapter.</p></li>
