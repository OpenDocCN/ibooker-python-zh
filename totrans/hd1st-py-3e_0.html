<h1>Install the latest Python 3</h1>
<p>What you do here depends on the platform you’re running, which is assumed to be one of <em>Windows</em>, <em>macOS</em>, or <em>Linux</em>.</p>
<p>The good news is that all three platforms run that latest Python, release 3.10. There’s no bad news.</p>

<p>If you are already running release 3.10 or later, move to the next page – you’re ready. If you haven’t already installed Python or are using an older version, select the paragraph below which applies to you, and read on.</p>
<section data-pdf-bookmark="Installing on Windows" data-type="sect2"><div class="sect2" id="installing_on_windows">
<h2>Installing on Windows</h2>
<p>The wonderful Python folk at <em>Microsoft</em> work hard to ensure the most-recent release of Python is always available to you via the <em>Windows Store</em> application. Open the Store, search for “Python”, select the most-recent version, then click the <strong>Get</strong> button. Watch patiently while the progress indicator moves from zero to 100% then, once the install completes, move to the next page – you’re ready.</p>

<section data-pdf-bookmark="Installing on macOS" data-type="sect2"><div class="sect2" id="installing_on_macos">
<h2>Installing on macOS</h2>
<p>The latest Macs ship with older, out-of-date releases of Python. <em>Don’t use these</em>. Instead, head over to Python’s home on the web, <a href="https://www.python.org/">https://www.python.org/</a>, then click on the “Downloads” option. The latest release of Python 3 should being to download, as the Python site is smart enough to spot you’re connecting from a Mac. Once the download completes, run the installer that’s waiting for you in your Downloads folder. Click the <strong>Next</strong> button until there are no more <strong>Next</strong> buttons to click then, when the install is complete, move to the next page – you’re ready.</p>

<section data-pdf-bookmark="Installing on Linux" data-type="sect2"><div class="sect2" id="installing_on_linux">
<h2>Installing on Linux</h2>
<p>The <em>Head First Coders</em> are a rag-tag team of techies whose job is to keep the <em>Head First Authors</em> on the straight and narrow (no mean feat). The coders love <em>Linux</em> and the <em>Ubuntu</em> distribution, so that’s discussed here.</p>
<p>It should come as no surprise that the latest Ubuntu comes with Python 3 installed and up-to-date. If this is the case, cool, you’re all set. If you are using a Linux distribution other than Ubuntu, use your system’s package manager to install Python 10 (or later) into your Linux system. Once done, move to the next page – you’re ready.</p>
<p><strong>Let’s complete your install with two things: a required back-end dependency, as well as a modern, Python-aware text editor.</strong></p>

<h1>Python on its own is not enough</h1>
<p>In order to explore, experiment, and learn about Python, you need to install a runtime back-end called <em>Jupyter</em> into your Python. As you’ll see in a moment, doing so is straightforward.</p>
<p>When it comes to creating Python code, you can use just about <em>any</em> programmer’s editor, but we’re recommending you use a specific one when working through this book’s material: Microsoft’s <em>Visual Studio Code</em>, known the world over as <strong>VS Code</strong>.</p>

</div>
<p>Regardless of the operating system you’re running, make sure you’re connected to the Internet, open a Terminal window, then type:</p>
<pre data-type="programlisting"><strong>python3 -m pip install jupyter</strong></pre>
<p>A veritable slew of status messages whiz by on screen. If you are seeing a message near the end stating everything is “Successfully installed”, then you’re golden. If not, check the Jupyter docs and try again.</p>

<p>Grab your favorite browser and surf on over to the VS Code download page:</p>

<div data-type="note" epub:type="note"><h6>Note</h6>
<p><span style="color:#636466">Their are alternatives to VS Code, but – in our view – VS Code is hard to beat when it comes to this book’s material. And, no, we are *not* part of some global conspiracy to promote Microsoft products!!</span></p>

<p>Pick the download which matches your environment, then wait for the download to complete. Follow the instructions from the site to install VS Code, then flip the page to learn how to complete your VS Code setup.</p>

<p>Go ahead and run VS Code for the first time. From the menu, select the <strong>File</strong>, then <strong>Preferences</strong>, then <strong>Settings</strong> to access the editor’s settings preferences.</p>
<div data-type="note" epub:type="note"><h6>Note</h6>
<p><span style="color:#636466">On the Mac, start with the “Code” menu.</span></p>

<p>You should see something like this:</p>

<p>Until you become familiar with VS Code, you may wish to configure your editor to match the settings preferred by the <em>Head First Coders</em>. Here are the settings used in this book:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The <em>indentation guides</em> are switched off.</p></li>
<li><p>The editor’s <em>appearance theme</em> is set to <em>Light</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>The editor <em>minimap</em> is disabled.</p></li>
<li><p>The editor’s <em>occurrences highlight</em> is switched off.</p></li>
<li><p>The editor’s <em>render line highlight</em> is set to <strong>none</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>The terminal and text editor’s <em>font size</em> is set to <strong>14</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>The notebook’s <em>show cell status bar</em> is set to <strong>hidden</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>The editor’s <em>lightbulb</em> is disabled.</p></li>
</ul>
<div data-type="note" epub:type="note"><h6>Note</h6>
<p><span style="color:#636466">You don’t have to use these settings but, if you want to match on your screen what you see in this book, then these adjustments are recommended.</span></p>

<p>Whereas you are not obliged to copy the recommended editor setup, you absolutely have to install two VS Code extensions, namely <strong>Python</strong> and <strong>Jupyter</strong>.</p>
<p>When you are done adjusting your preferred editor settings, close the Settings tab by clicking the X. Then, to search for, select, and install extensions, click on the Extensions icon to the left of the main VS Code screen:</p>

<p>Installing the Python and Jupyter extensions actually results in a few additional VS Code extension installations, as shown here:</p>

<p>These additional extensions enhance VS Code’s support for Python and Jupyter over and above what’s included in the standard extensions. Although you don’t need to know what these extra extensions do (for now), know this: They help turn VS Code into a <em>supercharged</em> Python editor.</p>

<p>Throughout this book you’ll encounter technical call-out boxes like this. These <em>Geek Note</em> boxes are used to delve into a specific topic in a bit more detail than we’d normally do in the main text. Don’t panic if the material in these boxes throws you off your game. They are designed to appease your curious inner nerd. You can safely (and without guilt) skip any <em>Geek Note</em> on a first-reading.</p>
