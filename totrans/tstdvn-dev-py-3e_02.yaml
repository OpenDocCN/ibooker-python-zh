    It covers the content of [Part I](part01.xhtml#part1). If you find you learn well
    from video-based material, then I encourage you to check it out. Over and above
    what’s in the book, it should give you a feel for what the “flow” of TDD is like,
    flicking between tests and code, explaining the thought process as we go.
