    computing today: the growing need for scalable computing. This trend is being
    driven, in large part, by the proliferation of machine learning (ML) throughout
    many industries and the growing amount of computational resources needed to do
    ML in practice.'

- en: The last decade has seen significant shifts in the nature of computing. In 2012,
    when I first began working in ML, much of it was managed on a single laptop or
    server, and many practitioners were using Matlab. That year was something of an
    inflection point as deep learning made a splash by winning the ImageNet competition
    by an astounding margin. That led to a sustained trend over many years in which
    more and more computation on more and more data has led to better results. This
    trend has yet to show signs of slowing down and, if anything, has accelerated
    in recent years with the advent of large language models.

    changed the practice of ML. Software engineering now plays a central role in ML,
    and teams and organizations that successfully leverage ML often build large in-house
    infrastructure teams to support the distributed systems necessary for scaling
    ML applications across hundreds or thousands of machines.

    relevant for a variety of businesses, it is also becoming increasingly difficult
    to do because of the significant infrastructure investment required to do it.

- en: To get to a state where every business can leverage and get value out of ML,
    we will have to make it far easier to apply in practice. This will mean eliminating
    the need for developers to become experts in distributed systems and infrastructure.

- en: This goal, making scalable computing and scalable ML easy to do, is the purpose
    of Ray and the reason that we created Ray in the first place. This is a natural
    continuation of a progression in computing. Going back a handful of decades, there
    was a time when developers had to program in Assembly Language and other low-level
    machine languages in order to build applications, and so the best developers were
    the people who could perform low-level memory optimizations and other manipulations.
    That made software development difficult to do and limited the number of people
    who could build applications. Today, very few developers think about Assembly.
    It is no longer on the critical path for application development, and as a result,
    far more people can develop applications and build great products today.

- en: The same thing will happen with infrastructure. Today, building and managing
    infrastructure for scaling Python applications and scaling ML applications is
    on the critical path for doing ML and for building scalable applications and products.
    However, infrastructure will go the way of Assembly Language. When that happens,
    it will open up the door and far more people will build these kinds of applications.

- en: '*Scaling Python and Ray* can serve as an entry point for anyone looking to
    do ML in practice or looking to build the next generation of scalable products
    and applications. It touches on a wide variety of topics, ranging from scaling
    a variety of important ML patterns, from deep learning to hyperparameter tuning
    to reinforcement learning. It touches on the best practices for scaling data ingest
    and preprocessing. It covers the fundamentals of building scalable applications.
    Importantly, it touches on how Ray fits into the broader ML and computing ecosystem.'

    trend in computing and can equip you with the tools to navigate and leverage that
    trend as you look to apply ML to your business or build the next great product
    and application.
