<h1>Mysteries</h1>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Let’s begin with two mini-mysteries and their solutions.&#13;
What do you think the following two lines mean?</p>&#13;
&#13;
<pre data-type="programlisting">(Row 1): (RS) K18,ssk,k1,turn work.&#13;
(Row 2): (WS) Sl 1 pwise,p5,p2tog,p1,turn.</pre>&#13;
&#13;
<p>It looks technical, like some kind of computer program.&#13;
Actually, it’s a <em>knitting pattern</em>;&#13;
specifically,&#13;
a fragment describing how to turn the heel of a sock, like the one in <a data-type="xref" href="#fig_socks">Figure 1-1</a>.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<figure class="width-75"><div class="figure" id="fig_socks">&#13;
<img alt="socks" src="assets/inp2_0101.png"/>&#13;
<h6><span class="label">Figure 1-1. </span>Knitted socks</h6>&#13;
</div></figure>&#13;
&#13;
<p>This makes as much sense to me as&#13;
a Sudoku puzzle does to one of my cats,&#13;
but my wife understands it perfectly.&#13;
If you’re a knitter, you do, too.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Let’s try another mysterious text, found on an index card.&#13;
You’ll figure out its purpose right away,&#13;
although you might not know its final product:</p>&#13;
&#13;
<pre data-type="programlisting">  1/2 c. butter or margarine&#13;
  1/2 c. cream&#13;
  2 1/2 c. flour&#13;
  1 t. salt&#13;
  1 T. sugar&#13;
  4 c. riced potatoes (cold)&#13;
&#13;
Be sure all ingredients are cold before adding flour.&#13;
Mix all ingredients.&#13;
Knead thoroughly.&#13;
Form into 20 balls.  Store cold until the next step.&#13;
For each ball:&#13;
  Spread flour on cloth.&#13;
  Roll ball into a circle with a grooved rolling pin.&#13;
  Fry on griddle until brown spots appear.&#13;
  Turn over and fry other side.</pre>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Even if you don’t cook, you probably&#13;
recognized that it’s a&#13;
<em>recipe</em><sup><a data-type="noteref" href="ch01.html#idm45795040338904" id="idm45795040338904-marker">1</a></sup>:&#13;
a list of food ingredients followed by directions for preparation.&#13;
But what does it make?&#13;
It’s <em>lefse</em>,&#13;
a Norwegian delicacy that resembles a tortilla (<a data-type="xref" href="#fig_lefse">Figure 1-2</a>).&#13;
Slather on some butter and jam or whatever you like,&#13;
roll it up, and enjoy.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<figure><div class="figure" id="fig_lefse">&#13;
<img alt="lefse" src="assets/inp2_0102.png"/>&#13;
<h6><span class="label">Figure 1-2. </span>Lefse</h6>&#13;
</div></figure>&#13;
&#13;
<p class="pagebreak-before">The knitting pattern and the recipe share some features:</p>&#13;
&#13;
<ul>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p><a data-primary="programs (generally)" data-secondary="elements of" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45795040332904"/><a data-primary="programs (generally)" data-seealso="processes" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45795040331928"/>A regular <em>vocabulary</em> of words, abbreviations, and symbols.&#13;
Some might be familiar, others mystifying.</p>&#13;
</li>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p>Rules about what can be said, and where—<em>syntax</em>.</p>&#13;
</li>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p>A <em>sequence of operations</em> to be performed in order.</p>&#13;
</li>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p>Sometimes, a repetition of some operations (a <em>loop</em>),&#13;
such as the method for frying each piece of lefse.</p>&#13;
</li>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p>Sometimes, a reference to another sequence of operations&#13;
(in computer terms, a <em>function</em>).&#13;
In the recipe,&#13;
you might need to refer to another recipe&#13;
for ricing potatoes.</p>&#13;
</li>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p>Assumed knowledge about the <em>context</em>.&#13;
The recipe assumes you that know what water is and how to boil it.&#13;
The knitting pattern assumes that you can knit and purl&#13;
without stabbing yourself too often.</p>&#13;
</li>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p>Some <em>data</em> to be used, created, or modified—potatoes and yarn.</p>&#13;
</li>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p>The <em>tools</em> used to work with the data—pots, mixers, ovens, knitting sticks.</p>&#13;
</li>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p>An expected <em>result</em>. In our examples, something for your feet&#13;
and something for your stomach. Just don’t mix them up.</p>&#13;
</li>&#13;
</ul>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Whatever you call them—idioms, jargon, little languages—you see examples of them everywhere.&#13;
The lingo saves time for people who know it,&#13;
while mystifying the rest of us.&#13;
Try deciphering a newspaper column about bridge if you don’t&#13;
play the game,&#13;
or a scientific paper if you’re not a scientist&#13;
(or even if you are, but in a different field).</p>&#13;

<section data-pdf-bookmark="Little Programs" data-type="sect1"><div class="sect1" id="idm45795040348024">&#13;
<h1>Little Programs</h1>&#13;
&#13;
<p><a data-primary="programs (generally)" data-secondary="example of simple program" data-type="indexterm" id="ix_ch01-intro-asciidoc1"/>You’ll see all of these ideas in computer programs,&#13;
which are themselves like little languages,&#13;
specialized for humans to tell computers what to do.&#13;
I used the knitting pattern and recipe to demonstrate that&#13;
programming isn’t that mysterious.&#13;
It’s largely a matter of learning the right words&#13;
and the rules.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Now, it helps greatly if there aren’t too many words and rules,&#13;
and if you don’t need to learn too many of them at once.&#13;
Our brains can hold only so much at one time.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Let’s finally see a real computer program (<a data-type="xref" href="#ch01_ex1">Example 1-1</a>).&#13;
What do you think this does?</p>&#13;
<div data-type="example" id="ch01_ex1">&#13;
<h5><span class="label">Example 1-1. </span>countdown.py</h5>&#13;
&#13;
<pre data-code-language="python" data-type="programlisting"><code class="k">for</code> <code class="n">countdown</code> <code class="ow">in</code> <code class="mi">5</code><code class="p">,</code> <code class="mi">4</code><code class="p">,</code> <code class="mi">3</code><code class="p">,</code> <code class="mi">2</code><code class="p">,</code> <code class="mi">1</code><code class="p">,</code> <code class="s2">"hey!"</code><code class="p">:</code>&#13;
    <code class="k">print</code><code class="p">(</code><code class="n">countdown</code><code class="p">)</code></pre></div>&#13;
&#13;
<p class="pagebreak-before">If you guessed that it’s a Python program that prints the lines</p>&#13;
&#13;
<pre data-type="programlisting">5&#13;
4&#13;
3&#13;
2&#13;
1&#13;
hey!</pre>&#13;
&#13;
<p>then you know that Python can be easier to&#13;
learn than a recipe or knitting pattern.&#13;
And you can practice writing Python programs&#13;
from the comfort and safety of your desk,&#13;
far from the hazards of hot water and pointy sticks.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>The Python program has some special words and symbols—<code>for</code>, <code>in</code>, <code>print</code>, commas, colons, parentheses, and so on—that are important parts of the language’s <em>syntax</em> (rules).&#13;
The good news is that Python has a nicer syntax,&#13;
and less of it to remember,&#13;
than most computer languages.&#13;
It seems more natural—almost like a recipe.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p><a data-type="xref" href="#ch01_ex2">Example 1-2</a> is another tiny Python program; it selects&#13;
one Harry Potter spell from a Python <em>list</em>&#13;
and prints it.</p>&#13;
<div data-type="example" id="ch01_ex2">&#13;
<h5><span class="label">Example 1-2. </span>spells.py</h5>&#13;
&#13;
<pre data-code-language="python" data-type="programlisting"><code class="n">spells</code> <code class="o">=</code> <code class="p">[</code>&#13;
    <code class="s2">"Riddikulus!"</code><code class="p">,</code>&#13;
    <code class="s2">"Wingardium Leviosa!"</code><code class="p">,</code>&#13;
    <code class="s2">"Avada Kedavra!"</code><code class="p">,</code>&#13;
    <code class="s2">"Expecto Patronum!"</code><code class="p">,</code>&#13;
    <code class="s2">"Nox!"</code><code class="p">,</code>&#13;
    <code class="s2">"Lumos!"</code><code class="p">,</code>&#13;
    <code class="p">]</code>&#13;
<code class="k">print</code><code class="p">(</code><code class="n">spells</code><code class="p">[</code><code class="mi">3</code><code class="p">])</code></pre></div>&#13;
&#13;
<p><a data-primary="strings" data-secondary="defined" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45795039682264"/>The individual spells are Python <em>strings</em>&#13;
(sequences of text characters, enclosed in quotes).&#13;
They’re separated by commas and&#13;
enclosed in a Python <em>list</em> that’s defined&#13;
by enclosing square brackets (<code>[</code> and <code>]</code>).&#13;
The word <code>spells</code> is a <em>variable</em> that gives the list&#13;
a name so that we can do things with it.&#13;
In this case,&#13;
the program would print the fourth spell:</p>&#13;
&#13;
<pre data-type="programlisting">Expecto Patronum!</pre>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Why did we say <code>3</code> if we wanted the fourth?&#13;
<a data-primary="offset" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45795039524776"/>A Python list such as <code>spells</code> is&#13;
a sequence of values,&#13;
accessed by their <em>offset</em> from&#13;
the beginning of the list.&#13;
The first value is at offset <code>0</code>,&#13;
and the fourth value is at offset <code>3</code>.</p>&#13;
<div data-type="note" epub:type="note"><h6>Note</h6>&#13;
<p>People count from 1,&#13;
so it might seem weird to count from 0.&#13;
It helps to think in terms of&#13;
offsets instead of positions.&#13;
Yes, this is an example of how computer programs&#13;
sometimes differ from common language usage.</p>&#13;
</div>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Lists are very common <em>data structures</em> in Python,&#13;
and <a data-type="xref" href="ch07.html#ch_lists">Chapter 7</a> shows how to use them.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>The program in <a data-type="xref" href="#ch01_ex3">Example 1-3</a> prints a quote&#13;
from one of the Three Stooges,&#13;
but referenced by who said it&#13;
rather than its position in a list.</p>&#13;
<div data-type="example" id="ch01_ex3">&#13;
<h5><span class="label">Example 1-3. </span>quotes.py</h5>&#13;
&#13;
<pre data-code-language="python" data-type="programlisting"><code class="n">quotes</code> <code class="o">=</code> <code class="p">{</code>&#13;
    <code class="s2">"Moe"</code><code class="p">:</code> <code class="s2">"A wise guy, huh?"</code><code class="p">,</code>&#13;
    <code class="s2">"Larry"</code><code class="p">:</code> <code class="s2">"Ow!"</code><code class="p">,</code>&#13;
    <code class="s2">"Curly"</code><code class="p">:</code> <code class="s2">"Nyuk nyuk!"</code><code class="p">,</code>&#13;
    <code class="p">}</code>&#13;
<code class="n">stooge</code> <code class="o">=</code> <code class="s2">"Curly"</code>&#13;
<code class="k">print</code><code class="p">(</code><code class="n">stooge</code><code class="p">,</code> <code class="s2">"says:"</code><code class="p">,</code> <code class="n">quotes</code><code class="p">[</code><code class="n">stooge</code><code class="p">])</code></pre></div>&#13;
&#13;
<p>If you were to run this little program, it would print the following:</p>&#13;
&#13;
<pre data-type="programlisting">Curly says: Nyuk nyuk!</pre>&#13;
&#13;
<p><a data-primary="dictionaries" data-secondary="defined" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45795039491512"/><code>quotes</code> is a variable that names a Python <em>dictionary</em>—a collection of unique <em>keys</em>&#13;
(in this example, the name of the Stooge)&#13;
and associated <em>values</em>&#13;
(here, a notable saying of that Stooge).&#13;
Using a dictionary, you can store and look up things by name,&#13;
which is often a useful alternative to a list.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>The <code>spells</code> example&#13;
used square brackets (<code>[</code> and <code>]</code>) to make a Python list,&#13;
and the <code>quotes</code> example&#13;
uses curly brackets (<code>{</code> and <code>}</code>,&#13;
which are no relation to Curly), to make&#13;
a Python dictionary.&#13;
Also, a colon (<code>:</code>) is used to associate each&#13;
key in the dictionary with its value.&#13;
You can read much more about dictionaries in <a data-type="xref" href="ch08.html#ch_dicts">Chapter 8</a>.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>That wasn’t too much syntax at once, I hope.&#13;
In the next few chapters, you’ll encounter more of these&#13;
little rules, a bit at a time.<a data-startref="ix_ch01-intro-asciidoc1" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45795039483784"/></p>&#13;

<section data-pdf-bookmark="A Bigger Program" data-type="sect1"><div class="sect1" id="idm45795040423432">&#13;
<h1>A Bigger Program</h1>&#13;
&#13;
<p><a data-primary="programs (generally)" data-secondary="example of complex program" data-type="indexterm" id="ix_ch01-intro-asciidoc2"/>And now for something completely different:&#13;
<a data-type="xref" href="#ch01_ex4">Example 1-4</a> presents&#13;
a Python program performing a more complex&#13;
series of tasks.&#13;
Don’t expect to understand how the program works yet;&#13;
that’s what this book is for!&#13;
The intent is to introduce you to the look and feel of a&#13;
typical nontrivial Python program.&#13;
If you know other computer languages,&#13;
evaluate how Python compares.&#13;
Even without knowing Python yet,&#13;
can you roughly figure out what each line does&#13;
before reading the explanation after the program?&#13;
You’ve already seen examples of a Python list and a dictionary,&#13;
and this throws in a few more features.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>In earlier printings of this book,&#13;
the sample program&#13;
connected to a YouTube website&#13;
and retrieved information on its most highly rated videos,&#13;
like “Charlie Bit My Finger.”&#13;
It worked well until&#13;
shortly after the ink was dry on the second printing.&#13;
That’s when Google dropped support for this service and the&#13;
marquee sample program stopped working.&#13;
Our new <a data-type="xref" href="#ch01_ex4">Example 1-4</a> goes to another site&#13;
which should be around longer—the <em>Wayback Machine</em> at the <a href="http://archive.org">Internet Archive</a>,&#13;
a free service that has saved billions of web pages&#13;
(and movies, TV shows, music, games, and other digital artifacts)&#13;
over 20 years.&#13;
You’ll see more examples of such <em>web APIs</em> in <a data-type="xref" href="ch18.html#ch_web">Chapter 18</a>.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>The program will ask you to type a URL and a date.&#13;
Then, it asks the Wayback Machine&#13;
if it has a copy of that website around that date.&#13;
If it found one,&#13;
it returns the information to this Python program,&#13;
which prints the URL&#13;
and displays it in your web browser.&#13;
The point is to show how Python handles a variety of tasks—get your typed input,&#13;
communicate across the internet to a website,&#13;
get back some content,&#13;
extract a URL from it,&#13;
and convince your web browser to display that URL.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>If we got back a normal web page full of HTML-formatted text,&#13;
we would need to figure out how to display it, which is a lot of work&#13;
that we happily entrust to web browsers.&#13;
We could also try to extract the parts that we want&#13;
(see more details about <em>web scraping</em> in <a data-type="xref" href="ch18.html#ch_web">Chapter 18</a>).&#13;
Either choice would be more work and a larger program.&#13;
Instead, the Wayback Machine returns data in <em>JSON</em> format.&#13;
<a data-primary="JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45795039471256"/>JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)&#13;
is a human-readable text format that describes the&#13;
types, values, and order of&#13;
the data within it.&#13;
It’s another little language,&#13;
and it has become a popular way to exchange data&#13;
among different computer languages and systems.&#13;
You’ll read more about JSON in <a data-type="xref" href="ch12.html#ch_munging">Chapter 12</a>.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Python programs can translate JSON text into Python&#13;
<em>data structures</em>—the kind you’ll see in the next few chapters—as though you wrote a program to create them yourself.&#13;
Our little program just selects one piece&#13;
(the URL of the old page from the Internet Archive website).&#13;
Again, this is a complete Python program&#13;
that you can run yourself.&#13;
We’ve included only a little error-checking,&#13;
just to keep the example short.&#13;
The line numbers are not part of the program; they are included to help you follow the description&#13;
that we provide after the program.</p>&#13;

&#13;
<p>This little Python program did a lot&#13;
in a few fairly readable lines.&#13;
You don’t know all these terms yet, but&#13;
you will within the next few chapters.&#13;
Here’s what’s going on in each line:</p>&#13;
<ol>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p><em>Import</em> (make available to this program) all the code&#13;
from the Python <em>standard library</em> module called <code>webbrowser</code>.</p>&#13;
</li>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p>Import all the code from the Python&#13;
standard library module called <code>json</code>.</p>&#13;
</li>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p>Import only the <code>urlopen</code> <em>function</em> from the&#13;
standard library module <code>urllib.request</code>.</p>&#13;
</li>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p>A blank line, because we don’t want to feel crowded.</p>&#13;
</li>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p>Print some initial text to your display.</p>&#13;
</li>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p>Print a question about a URL, read what you type,&#13;
and save it in a program <em>variable</em> called <code>site</code>.</p>&#13;
</li>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p>Print another question, this time reading a year,&#13;
month, and day, and then save it in a variable called <code>era</code>.</p>&#13;
</li>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p>Construct a string variable called <code>url</code> to make the&#13;
Wayback Machine look up its copy of the&#13;
site and date that you typed.</p>&#13;
</li>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p>Connect to the web server at that URL and&#13;
request a particular <em>web service</em>.</p>&#13;
</li>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p>Get the response data and assign to the variable <code>contents</code>.</p>&#13;
</li>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p><em>Decode</em> <code>contents</code> to a text string in JSON format,&#13;
and assign to the variable <code>text</code>.</p>&#13;
</li>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p>Convert <code>text</code> to <code>data</code>—Python data structures.</p>&#13;
</li>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p>Error-checking: <code>try</code> to run the next four lines,&#13;
and if any fail, run the last line of the program&#13;
(after the <code>except</code>).</p>&#13;
</li>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p>If we got back a match for this site and date,&#13;
extract its value from a three-level Python <em>dictionary</em>.&#13;
Notice that this line and the next two are indented.&#13;
That’s how Python knows that they go with the preceding <code>try</code> line.</p>&#13;
</li>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p>Print the URL that we found.</p>&#13;
</li>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p>Print what will happen after the next line executes.</p>&#13;
</li>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p>Display the URL we found in your web browser.</p>&#13;
</li>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p>If anything failed in the previous four lines,&#13;
Python jumps down to here.</p>&#13;
</li>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p>If it failed, print a message and the site that&#13;
we were looking for.&#13;
This is indented because it should be run only if&#13;
the preceding <code>except</code> line runs.</p>&#13;
</li>&#13;
&#13;
</ol>&#13;
&#13;
<p>When I ran this in a terminal window,&#13;
I typed a site URL and a date, and&#13;
got this text output:</p>&#13;
<pre>$ <strong>python archive.py</strong>&#13;
Let's find an old website.&#13;
Type a website URL: <strong>lolcats.com</strong>&#13;
Type a year, month, and day, like 20150613: <strong>20151022</strong>&#13;
Found this copy: http://web.archive.org/web/20151102055938/http://www.lolcats.com/&#13;
It should appear in your browser now.</pre>&#13;
&#13;
<p>And <a data-type="xref" href="#img_archive">Figure 1-3</a> shows what appeared in my browser.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<figure><div class="figure" id="img_archive">&#13;

<h6><span class="label">Figure 1-3. </span>From the Wayback Machine</h6>&#13;
</div></figure>&#13;
&#13;
<p>In the previous example,&#13;
we used some of Python’s&#13;
<em>standard library</em> modules&#13;
(programs that are included with Python&#13;
when it’s installed),&#13;
but there’s nothing sacred about them.&#13;
Python has a trove of excellent third-party software.&#13;
<a data-type="xref" href="#ch01_ex5">Example 1-5</a> is a rewrite that&#13;
accesses the Internet Archive website&#13;

&#13;
<p><a data-primary="Python (generally)" data-secondary="real-world applications" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45795028584120"/>So, is learning Python worth the time and effort?&#13;
Python has been around since 1991&#13;
(older than Java, younger than C),&#13;
and is consistently in the top five most popular computing languages.&#13;
People are paid to write Python programs—serious stuff that you use every day,&#13;
such as Google, YouTube, Instagram, Netflix, and Hulu.&#13;
I’ve used it for production applications in many areas.&#13;
Python has a reputation for productivity that appeals&#13;
to fast-moving organizations.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>You’ll find Python in many computing environments, including these:</p>&#13;
&#13;
<ul>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p>The command line in a monitor or terminal window</p>&#13;
</li>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p>Graphical user interfaces (GUIs), including the web</p>&#13;
</li>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p>The web, on the client and server sides</p>&#13;
</li>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p>Backend servers supporting large popular sites</p>&#13;
</li>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p>The <em>cloud</em> (servers managed by third parties)</p>&#13;
</li>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p>Mobile devices</p>&#13;
</li>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p>Embedded devices</p>&#13;
</li>&#13;
</ul>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Python programs range from one-off <em>scripts</em>—such as those you’ve seen so far in this chapter—to million-line systems.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p><a href="https://oreil.ly/8vK7y">The 2018 Python Developers’ Survey</a>&#13;
has numbers and graphs on Python’s current place in the computing world.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>We’ll look at its uses in websites, system administration,&#13;
and data manipulation.&#13;
In the final chapters, we’ll see specific uses of Python in&#13;
the arts, science, and business.</p>&#13;

<h1>Python Versus the Language from Planet X</h1>&#13;
&#13;
<p><a data-primary="Python (generally)" data-secondary="other languages compared to" data-type="indexterm" id="ix_ch01-intro-asciidoc3"/>How does Python compare against other languages?&#13;
Where and when would you choose one over the other?&#13;
In this section, I show code samples from other&#13;
languages, just so you can see what the competition&#13;
looks like.&#13;
You are <em>not</em> expected to understand these if you&#13;
haven’t worked with them.&#13;
(By the time you get to the final Python sample,&#13;
you might be relieved that you haven’t had to work with some&#13;
of the others.)</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Each program is supposed to print a number&#13;
and say a little about the language.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p><a data-primary="shell program" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45795028567560"/>If you use a terminal or terminal window,&#13;
the program that reads what you type, runs it,&#13;
and displays the results&#13;
is called the <em>shell</em> program.&#13;
<a data-primary="Windows" data-secondary="shell" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45795028565800"/>The Windows shell is called&#13;
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cmd.exe"><code>cmd</code></a>;&#13;
it runs <em>batch</em> files with the suffix <code>.bat</code>.&#13;
<a data-primary="Linux" data-secondary="shell" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45795028562920"/>Linux and other Unix-like systems&#13;
(including macOS)&#13;
have many shell programs.&#13;
The most popular is called&#13;
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/bash"><code>bash</code></a>&#13;
or <code>sh</code>.&#13;
The shell has simple abilities,&#13;
such as simple logic and expanding wildcard symbols such as&#13;
<code>*</code> into filenames.&#13;
You can save commands in files called&#13;
<em>shell scripts</em> and run them later.&#13;
These might be the first programs you encountered&#13;
as a programmer.&#13;
The problem is that shell scripts don’t scale well&#13;
beyond a few hundred lines,&#13;
and they are much slower than the alternative languages.&#13;
The next snippet shows a little shell program:</p>&#13;
&#13;
<pre data-type="programlisting">#!/bin/sh&#13;
language=0&#13;
echo "Language $language: I am the shell. So there."</pre>&#13;
&#13;
<p>If you saved this in a file as <code>test.sh</code>&#13;
and ran it with <code>sh test.sh</code>,&#13;
you would see the following on your display:</p>&#13;
&#13;
<pre data-type="programlisting">Language 0: I am the shell. So there.</pre>&#13;
&#13;
<p><a data-primary="C" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45795028556456"/><a data-primary="C++" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45795028555752"/>Old stalwarts&#13;
<a href="https://oreil.ly/7QKsf">C</a>&#13;
and&#13;
<a href="https://oreil.ly/iOJPN">C++</a>&#13;
are fairly low-level languages,&#13;
used when speed is most important.&#13;
Your operating system and many of its programs&#13;
(including the <code>python</code> program on your computer)&#13;
are probably written&#13;
in C or C++.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>These two are harder to learn and maintain.&#13;
You need to keep track of many details like&#13;
<em>memory management</em>,&#13;
which can lead to program crashes and problems&#13;
that are difficult to diagnose.&#13;
Here’s a little C program:</p>&#13;
&#13;
<pre data-type="programlisting">#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;&#13;
int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {&#13;
    int language = 1;&#13;
    printf("Language %d: I am C! See? Si!\n", language);&#13;
    return 0;&#13;
}</pre>&#13;
&#13;
<p>C++ has the C family resemblance&#13;
but has evolved some distinctive features:</p>&#13;
&#13;
<pre data-type="programlisting">#include &lt;iostream&gt;&#13;
using namespace std;&#13;
int main() {&#13;
    int language = 2;&#13;
    cout &lt;&lt; "Language " &lt;&lt; language &lt;&lt; \&#13;
       ": I am C++!  Pay no attention to my little brother!" &lt;&lt; \&#13;
       endl;&#13;
    return(0);&#13;
}</pre>&#13;
&#13;
<p><a data-primary="C#" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45795028549448"/><a data-primary="Java" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45795028548744"/><a href="https://www.java.com">Java</a>&#13;
and&#13;
<a href="https://oreil.ly/1wo5A">C#</a>&#13;
are successors to C and C++ that avoid some of their forebears’ problems—especially memory management—but can be somewhat verbose.&#13;
The example that follows shows some Java:</p>&#13;
&#13;
<pre data-type="programlisting">public class Anecdote {&#13;
    public static void main (String[] args) {&#13;
        int language = 3;&#13;
        System.out.format("Language %d: I am Java! So there!\n", language);&#13;
    }&#13;
}</pre>&#13;
&#13;
<p>If you haven’t written programs in any of these&#13;
languages, you might wonder:&#13;
what is all that <em>stuff</em>?&#13;
We only wanted to print a simple line.&#13;
Some languages carry substantial syntactic baggage.&#13;
You’ll learn more about this in <a data-type="xref" href="ch02.html#ch_names">Chapter 2</a>.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p><a data-primary="static languages" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45795028543416"/>C, C++, and Java are examples of&#13;
<em>static languages</em>.&#13;
They require you to specify&#13;
some low-level details like data types for the computer.&#13;
<a data-type="xref" href="app01.html#app_computers">Appendix A</a> shows how a data type like an integer&#13;
has a specific number of bits in your computer,&#13;
and can only do integer-ey things.&#13;
<a data-primary="dynamic languages" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45795028541032"/>In contrast, <em>dynamic languages</em>&#13;
(also called <em>scripting languages</em>)&#13;
do not force you to declare variable types&#13;
before using them.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p><a data-primary="Perl" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45795028539208"/>The all-purpose dynamic language for many years was&#13;
<a href="http://www.perl.org">Perl</a>.&#13;
Perl is very powerful and has extensive libraries.&#13;
Yet, its syntax can be awkward,&#13;
and the language&#13;
seems to have lost momentum in the past few years to Python and Ruby.&#13;
This example regales you with a Perl bon mot:</p>&#13;
&#13;
<pre data-type="programlisting">my $language = 4;&#13;
print "Language $language: I am Perl, the camel of languages.\n";</pre>&#13;
&#13;
<p><a data-primary="Ruby" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45795028536440"/><a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org">Ruby</a>&#13;
is a more recent language.&#13;
It borrows a little from Perl,&#13;
and is popular mostly&#13;
<a data-primary="Ruby on Rails" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45795028535112"/>because of <em>Ruby on Rails</em>, a web development framework.&#13;
It’s used in many of the same areas as Python,&#13;
and the choice of one or the other&#13;
might boil down to a matter of taste,&#13;
or available libraries for your particular application.&#13;
Here’s a Ruby snippet:</p>&#13;
&#13;
<pre data-type="programlisting">language = 5&#13;
puts "Language #{language}: I am Ruby, ready and aglow."</pre>&#13;
&#13;
<p><a href="http://www.php.net">PHP</a>,&#13;
which you can see in the example that follows,&#13;
is very popular for web development&#13;
because it makes it easy to combine HTML and code.&#13;
However, the PHP language itself has a number of gotchas,&#13;
and PHP has not caught on as a general language outside of the web. Here’s what it looks like:</p>&#13;
&#13;
<pre data-type="programlisting">&lt;?PHP&#13;
$language = 6;&#13;
echo "Language $language: I am PHP, a language and palindrome.\n";&#13;
?&gt;</pre>&#13;
&#13;
<p><a data-primary="Go (Golang)" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45795028530552"/><a href="https://golang.org">Go</a>&#13;
(or <em>Golang</em>, if you’re trying to Google it)&#13;
is a recent language that tries to be both efficient and friendly:</p>&#13;
&#13;
<pre data-type="programlisting">package main&#13;
&#13;
import "fmt"&#13;
&#13;
func main() {&#13;
  language := 7&#13;
  fmt.Printf("Language %d: Hey, ho, let's Go!\n", language)&#13;
}</pre>&#13;
&#13;
<p><a data-primary="Rust" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45795028527528"/>Another modern alternative to C and C++ is&#13;
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org">Rust</a>:</p>&#13;
&#13;
<pre data-type="programlisting">fn main() {&#13;
    println!("Language {}: Rust here!", 8)</pre>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Who’s left?&#13;
Oh yes, <a href="https://python.org">Python</a>:<a data-startref="ix_ch01-intro-asciidoc3" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45795028524040"/></p>&#13;

not necessarily the most important,&#13;
is popularity.&#13;
By various measures, Python is:</p>&#13;

<p>The&#13;

</li>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p>The editors of the June 2019&#13;
<a href="https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index">TIOBE Index</a> say:&#13;
“This month Python has reached again an all time high in TIOBE index of 8.5%. If Python can keep this pace, it will probably replace C and Java in 3 to 4 years time, thus becoming the most popular programming language of the world.”</p>&#13;

&#13;
<p>More recently,&#13;
it’s become extremely popular in the data science&#13;
and machine learning worlds.&#13;
If you want to land a well-paying programming job in an interesting&#13;
area, Python is a good choice now.&#13;
And if you’re hiring, there’s a growing pool&#13;
of experienced Python developers.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>But <em>why</em> is it popular?&#13;
Programming languages don’t exactly exude charisma.&#13;
What are some underlying reasons?</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Python is a good general-purpose, high-level language.&#13;
Its design makes it very <em>readable</em>,&#13;
which is more important than it sounds.&#13;
Every computer program is written only once,&#13;
but read and revised many times,&#13;
often by many people.&#13;
Being readable also makes it easier to learn&#13;
and remember; hence, more <em>writable</em>.&#13;
Compared with other popular languages,&#13;
Python has a gentle learning curve&#13;
that makes you productive sooner,&#13;
yet it has depths that you can explore as you gain&#13;
expertise.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Python’s relative terseness makes it possible for you to&#13;
write programs that are&#13;
smaller than their equivalents in a static language.&#13;
Studies have shown that programmers&#13;
tend to produce roughly the same number of lines&#13;
of code per day—regardless of the language—so, halving the lines of code doubles your productivity,&#13;
just like that.&#13;
Python is the not-so-secret weapon of&#13;
many companies that think this is important.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>And of course, Python is free,&#13;
as in beer (price) and speech (liberty).&#13;
Write anything you want with Python,&#13;
and use it anywhere, freely.&#13;
No one can read your Python program and say,&#13;
“That’s a nice little program you have there.&#13;
It would be a shame if something happened to it.”</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Python runs almost everywhere&#13;
and has “batteries included”—a metric boatload of useful&#13;
software in its standard library.&#13;
This book presents many examples of the standard library&#13;
and useful third-party Python code.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>But, maybe the best reason to use Python&#13;
is an unexpected one:&#13;
people generally <em>enjoy</em> programming with it&#13;
rather than seeing it as a necessary evil&#13;
to get stuff done.&#13;
It doesn’t get in the way.&#13;
A familiar quote is that it “fits your brain.”&#13;
Often, developers will say that they miss some Python design&#13;
when they need to work in another language.&#13;
And that separates Python from most of its peers.<a data-startref="ix_ch01-intro-asciidoc4" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45795028476472"/></p>&#13;

<h1>Why Not Python?</h1>&#13;
&#13;
<p><a data-primary="Python (generally)" data-secondary="situations not to use" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45795028474360"/>Python isn’t the best language for every situation.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>It is not installed everywhere by default.&#13;
<a data-type="xref" href="app02.html#app_install">Appendix B</a> shows you how to install Python&#13;
if you don’t already have it on your computer.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>It’s fast enough for most applications,&#13;
but it might not be fast enough for&#13;
some of the more demanding ones.&#13;
If your program spends most of its time calculating things&#13;
(the technical term is <em>CPU-bound</em>),&#13;
a program written in&#13;
C, C++, C#, Java, Rust,&#13;
or Go will generally run faster than&#13;
its Python equivalent.&#13;
But not always!</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p class="pagebreak-before">Here are some solutions:</p>&#13;
&#13;
<ul>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p>Sometimes a better <em>algorithm</em> (a stepwise solution)&#13;
in Python&#13;
beats an inefficient one in C.&#13;
The greater speed of development&#13;
in Python gives you more time to experiment with alternatives.</p>&#13;
</li>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p>In many applications (notably, the web),&#13;
a program twiddles its gossamer thumbs while awaiting a response&#13;
from some server across a network.&#13;
The CPU&#13;
(central processing unit,&#13;
the computer’s <em>chip</em> that does all the calculating)&#13;
is barely involved; consequently,&#13;
end-to-end times between static and dynamic programs will be close.</p>&#13;
</li>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p>The standard Python interpreter is written in C&#13;
and can be extended with C code.&#13;
I discuss this a little in <a data-type="xref" href="ch19.html#ch_pythonista">Chapter 19</a>.</p>&#13;
</li>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p>Python interpreters are becoming faster.&#13;
Java was terribly slow in its infancy, and a lot of research&#13;
and money went into speeding it up.&#13;
Python is not owned by a corporation,&#13;
so its enhancements have been more gradual.&#13;
In <a data-type="xref" href="ch19.html#pypy">“PyPy”</a>,&#13;
I talk about the <em>PyPy</em> project and its implications.</p>&#13;
</li>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p>You might have an extremely demanding application,&#13;
and no matter what you do, Python doesn’t meet your needs.&#13;
The usual alternatives are C, C++, and Java.&#13;
<a href="http://golang.org">Go</a>&#13;
(which feels like Python but performs like C)&#13;
or Rust&#13;
could also be worth a look.</p>&#13;

<h1>Python 2 Versus Python 3</h1>&#13;
&#13;
<p><a data-primary="Python (generally)" data-secondary="Python 2 versus Python 3" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45795028440680"/>One medium-sized complication&#13;
is that there are two versions of Python out there.&#13;
Python 2 has been around forever and is preinstalled&#13;
on Linux and Apple computers.&#13;
It has been an excellent language,&#13;
but nothing’s perfect.&#13;
In computer languages, as in many other areas,&#13;
some mistakes are cosmetic and easy to fix,&#13;
whereas others are hard.&#13;
Hard fixes are <em>incompatible</em>:&#13;
new programs written with them&#13;
will not work on the old Python system,&#13;
and old programs written before the fix&#13;
will not work on the new system.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Python’s creator&#13;
(<a href="https://www.python.org/~guido">Guido van Rossum</a>)&#13;
and others decided to bundle the hard fixes together,&#13;
and introduced them as Python 3 in 2008.&#13;
Python 2 is the past, and Python 3 is the future.&#13;
The final version of Python 2 is 2.7,&#13;
and it will be around for while,&#13;
but it’s the end of the line;&#13;
there will be no Python 2.8.&#13;
The end of Python 2 language support is in January of 2020.&#13;
Security and other fixes will no longer be made,&#13;
and many prominent Python packages&#13;
will&#13;
<a href="https://python3statement.org">drop support</a>&#13;
for Python 2 by then.&#13;
Operating systems will soon either&#13;
drop Python 2 or make 3 their new default.&#13;
Conversion of popular Python software to Python 3 had been gradual,&#13;
but we’re now well past the tipping point.&#13;
All new development will be in Python 3.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>This book is about Python 3.&#13;
It looks almost identical to Python 2.&#13;
The most obvious change is that <code>print</code> is a function in Python 3,&#13;
so you need to call it with parentheses&#13;
surrounding its arguments.&#13;
The most important change is the handling of <em>Unicode</em> characters,&#13;
which is covered in <a data-type="xref" href="ch12.html#ch_munging">Chapter 12</a>.&#13;
I point out other significant differences as they come up.</p>&#13;

<p>Rather than cluttering this chapter, you can find&#13;
the details on how to install Python 3 in <a data-type="xref" href="app02.html#app_install">Appendix B</a>.&#13;
If you don’t have Python 3, or aren’t sure,&#13;
go there and see what you need to do for your computer.&#13;
Yes, this is a pain in the wazoo&#13;
(specifically, the right-anterior wazoo),&#13;
but you’ll need to do it only once.</p>&#13;

<h1>Running Python</h1>&#13;
&#13;
<p><a data-primary="Python (generally)" data-secondary="running" data-type="indexterm" id="ix_ch01-intro-asciidoc5"/>After you have installed a working copy of Python 3,&#13;
you can use it to run the Python programs in this book&#13;
as well as your own Python code.&#13;
How do you actually run a Python program?&#13;
There are two main ways:</p>&#13;
&#13;
<ul>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p>Python’s built-in <em>interactive interpreter</em>&#13;
(also called its <em>shell</em>)&#13;
is the easy way to experiment with small programs.&#13;
You type commands line by line and&#13;
see the results immediately.&#13;
With the tight coupling between typing and seeing,&#13;
you can experiment faster.&#13;
I’ll use the interactive interpreter to demonstrate language features,&#13;
and you can type the same commands in your own Python&#13;
environment.</p>&#13;
</li>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p>For everything else,&#13;
store your Python programs in text files,&#13;
normally with the <em>.py</em> extension,&#13;
and run them by typing <code>python</code>&#13;
followed by those filenames.</p>&#13;
</li>&#13;
</ul>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Let’s try both methods now.</p>&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
<section data-pdf-bookmark="Using the Interactive Interpreter" data-type="sect2"><div class="sect2" id="idm45795028422616">&#13;
<h2>Using the Interactive Interpreter</h2>&#13;
&#13;
<p><a data-primary="interactive interpreter" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45795028421160"/><a data-primary="Python (generally)" data-secondary="interactive interpreter and" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45795028420456"/>Most of the code examples in this book&#13;
use the built-in interactive interpreter.&#13;
When you type the same commands as you see in the examples&#13;
and get the same results,&#13;
you’ll know you’re on the right track.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>You start the interpreter by typing just the name&#13;
of the main Python program on your computer:&#13;
it should be&#13;
<code>python</code>, <code>python3</code>, or something similar.&#13;
For the rest of this book,&#13;
we assume it’s called <code>python</code>;&#13;
if yours has a different name, type that&#13;
wherever you see <code>python</code> in a code example.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>The interactive interpreter works almost exactly the same&#13;
as Python works on files, with one exception:&#13;
when you type something that has a value,&#13;
the interactive interpreter&#13;
prints its value for you automatically.&#13;
This isn’t a part of the Python language, just a feature&#13;
of the interpreter to save you from typing <code>print()</code>&#13;
all the time.&#13;
For example, if you start Python&#13;
and type the number <code>27</code> in the interpreter,&#13;
it will be echoed to your terminal (if you have the line <code>27</code> in a file,&#13;
Python won’t get upset, but you won’t see anything print&#13;
when you run the program):</p>&#13;
<pre>$ <strong>python</strong>&#13;
Python 3.7.2 (v3.7.2:9a3ffc0492, Dec 24 2018, 02:44:43)&#13;
[Clang 6.0 (clang-600.0.57)] on darwin&#13;
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.&#13;
&gt;&gt;&gt; <strong>27</strong>&#13;
27</pre>&#13;
<div data-type="note" epub:type="note"><h6>Note</h6>&#13;
<p>In the preceding example,&#13;
<code>$</code> is a sample system <em>prompt</em> for&#13;
you to type a command like&#13;
<code>python</code>&#13;
in the&#13;
terminal window.&#13;
We use it for the code examples in this book,&#13;
although your prompt might be different.</p>&#13;
</div>&#13;
&#13;
<p>By the way,&#13;
<code>print()</code> also works within the interpreter&#13;
whenever you want to print something:</p>&#13;
&#13;
<pre data-code-language="pycon" data-type="programlisting"><code class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </code><code class="k">print</code><code class="p">(</code><code class="mi">27</code><code class="p">)</code>&#13;
<code class="go">27</code></pre>&#13;
&#13;
<p>If you tried these examples with the interactive&#13;
interpreter and saw the same results,&#13;
you just ran some real (though tiny) Python code.&#13;
In the next few chapters,&#13;
you’ll graduate from one-liners&#13;
to longer Python programs.</p>&#13;

<h2>Using Python Files</h2>&#13;
&#13;
<p><a data-primary="Python (generally)" data-secondary="noninteractive programs" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45795030994664"/>If you put <code>27</code> in a file by&#13;
itself and run it through Python,&#13;
it will run,&#13;
but it won’t print anything.&#13;
In normal noninteractive Python programs,&#13;
you need to call the <code>print</code> function to print things:</p>&#13;
&#13;
<pre data-code-language="python" data-type="programlisting"><code class="k">print</code><code class="p">(</code><code class="mi">27</code><code class="p">)</code></pre>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Let’s make a Python program file and run it:</p>&#13;
<ol>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p>Open your text editor.</p>&#13;
</li>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p>Type the line <code>print(27)</code>, as it appears here.</p>&#13;
</li>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p>Save this to a file called <em>test.py</em>.&#13;
Make sure you save it as plain text&#13;
rather than a “rich” format such as RTF or Word.&#13;
You don’t need to use the <em>.py</em> suffix for your Python&#13;
program files,&#13;
but it does help you remember what they are.</p>&#13;
</li>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p>If you’re using a GUI—that’s almost everyone—open a terminal window.<sup><a data-type="noteref" href="ch01.html#idm45795033687224" id="idm45795033687224-marker">2</a></sup></p>&#13;
</li>&#13;
<li>&#13;
<p>Run your program by typing the following:</p>&#13;
</li>&#13;
&#13;
</ol>&#13;
<pre>$ <strong>python test.py</strong></pre>&#13;
&#13;
<p>You should see a single line of output:</p>&#13;
&#13;
<pre data-type="programlisting">27</pre>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Did that work?&#13;
If it did, congratulations on running your first&#13;
standalone Python program.</p>&#13;

<h2>What’s Next?</h2>&#13;
&#13;
<p>You’ll be typing commands to an actual Python system,&#13;
and they need to follow legal Python syntax.&#13;
Rather than dumping the syntax rules on you all at once,&#13;
we stroll through them over the next few chapters.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>The basic way to develop Python programs&#13;
is by using a plain-text editor&#13;
and a terminal window.&#13;
I use plain-text displays in this book,&#13;
sometimes showing interactive terminal sessions&#13;
and sometimes pieces of Python files.&#13;
You should know that there are also many good&#13;
<em>integrated development environments</em> (IDEs) for Python.&#13;
These may feature GUIs with&#13;
advanced text editing and help displays.&#13;
You can learn about details for some of these in <a data-type="xref" href="ch19.html#ch_pythonista">Chapter 19</a>.<a data-startref="ix_ch01-intro-asciidoc5" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45795031533976"/></p>&#13;

include such an Easter egg).&#13;

<p><a data-primary="Python (generally)" data-secondary="practice exercises" data-type="indexterm" id="idm45795033664296"/>This chapter was an introduction to the Python&#13;
language—what it does, how it looks,&#13;
and where it fits in the computing world.&#13;
At the end of each chapter,&#13;
I suggest some mini-projects to help you&#13;
remember what you just read and prepare you for&#13;
what’s to come.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>1.1&#13;
If you don’t already have Python 3 installed&#13;
on your computer, do it now.&#13;
Read <a data-type="xref" href="app02.html#app_install">Appendix B</a> for the details&#13;
for your computer system.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>1.2&#13;
Start the Python 3 interactive interpreter.&#13;
Again, details are in <a data-type="xref" href="app02.html#app_install">Appendix B</a>.&#13;
It should print a few lines about itself and then&#13;
a single line starting with <code>&gt;&gt;&gt;</code>. That’s your&#13;
prompt to type Python commands.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>1.3&#13;
Play with the interpreter a little.&#13;
Use it like a calculator and type this:&#13;
<code>8 * 9</code>.&#13;
Press the Enter key to see the result.&#13;
Python should print <code>72</code>.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>1.4&#13;
Type the number <code>47</code> and press the Enter key.&#13;
Did it print <code>47</code> for you on the next line?</p>&#13;
&#13;
