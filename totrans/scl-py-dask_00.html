<h1>Preface</h1>


<p>We wrote this book for data scientists and data engineers familiar with Python and pandas who are looking to handle larger-scale problems than their current tooling allows. Current PySpark users will find that some of this material overlaps with their existing knowledge of PySpark, but we hope they still find it helpful, and not just for getting away from the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).</p>

<p>If you are not familiar with Python, some excellent O’Reilly titles include <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/learning-python-5th/9781449355722" class="orm:hideurl"><em>Learning Python</em></a> and <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/python-for-data/9781098104023" class="orm:hideurl"><em>Python for Data Analysis</em></a>. If you and your team are more frequent users of JVM languages (such as Java or Scala), while we are a bit biased, we’d encourage you to check out Apache Spark along with <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/learning-spark-2nd/9781492050032" class="orm:hideurl"><em>Learning Spark</em></a> (O’Reilly) and <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/high-performance-spark/9781098145842" class="orm:hideurl"><em>High Performance Spark</em></a> (O’Reilly).</p>

<p>This book is primarily focused on data science and related tasks because, in our opinion, that is where Dask excels the most. If you have a more general problem that Dask does not seem to be quite the right fit for, we would (with a bit of bias again) encourage you to check out <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/scaling-python-with/9781098118792" class="orm:hideurl"><em>Scaling Python with Ray</em></a> (O’Reilly), which has less of a data science focus.</p>

<h1>A Note on Responsibility</h1>

<p>As the saying goes, with great power comes great responsibility. Dask and tools like it enable you to process more data and build more complex models. It’s essential not to get carried away with collecting data simply for the sake of it, and to stop to ask yourself if including a new field in your model might have some unintended real-world implications. You don’t have to search very hard to find stories of well-meaning engineers and data scientists accidentally building models or tools that had devastating impacts, such as increased auditing of minorities, gender-based discrimination, or subtler things like biases in <a href="https://oreil.ly/tqjth">word embeddings</a> (a way to represent the meanings of words as vectors). Please use your newfound powers with such potential consequences in mind, for one never wants to end up in a textbook for the wrong reasons.</p>

<h1>Using Code Examples</h1>

<p>The <a href="https://oreil.ly/scaling-python-dask-code">Scaling Python Machine Learning GitHub repo</a> contains the majority of the examples in this book. They are mainly under the <em>dask</em> directory, with more esoteric parts (such as the cross-platform CUDA container) found in separate top-level directories.</p>

<p>If you have a technical question or a problem using the code examples, please email <a class="email" href="mailto:support@oreilly.com"><em>support@oreilly.com</em></a>.</p>

<p>This book is here to help you get your job done. In general, if example code is offered with this book, you may use it in your programs and documentation. You do not need to contact us for permission unless you’re reproducing a significant portion of the code. For example, writing a program that uses several chunks of code from this book does not require permission. Selling or distributing examples from O’Reilly books does require permission. Answering a question by citing this book and quoting example code does not require permission. Incorporating a significant amount of example code from this book into your product’s documentation does require permission.</p>

<p>We appreciate, but generally do not require, attribution. An attribution usually includes the title, author, publisher, and ISBN. For example: “<em>Scaling Python with Dask</em> by Holden Karau and Mika Kimmins (O’Reilly). Copyright 2023 Holden Karau and Mika Kimmins, 978-1-098-11987-4.”</p>

<h1>Acknowledgments</h1>

<p>This is a book written by two trans immigrants living in America at a time when the walls can feel like they’re closing in. We choose to dedicate this book to those fighting for a more just world in whichever way, however small—thank you. To all those we lost or didn’t get to meet, we miss you. To those we have yet to meet, we are excited to meet you.</p>

<p class="pagebreak-after">This book would not exist if not for the communities it is built on. From the Dask community to the PyData community, thank you. Thank you to all the early readers and reviewers for your contributions and guidance. These reviewers include Ruben Berenguel, Adam Breindel, Tom Drabas, Joseph Gnanaprakasam, John Iannone, Kevin Kho, Jess Males, and many more. A special thanks to Ann Spencer for reviewing the early proposals of what eventually became this and <em>Scaling Python with Ray</em>. Any remaining mistakes are entirely our fault, sometimes going against reviewers’ advice.<sup><a data-type="noteref" id="id286-marker" href="preface01.xhtml#id286">1</a></sup></p>

<p>Holden would also like to thank her wife and partners for putting up with her long in-the-bathtub writing sessions. A special thank you to Timbit for guarding the house and generally giving Holden a reason to get out of bed (albeit often a bit too early for her taste).</p>

<p>Mika would additionally like to thank Holden for her mentorship and help, and give a shout-out to her colleagues at the Harvard data science department for providing her with unlimited free coffee.</p>
