<h1>Preface</h1>


<p>We wrote this book for developers and data scientists looking to build and scale applications in Python without becoming systems administrators. We expect this book to be most beneficial for individuals and teams dealing with the growing complexity and scale of problems moving from single-threaded solutions to multithreaded, all the way to distributed computing.</p>

<p>While you can use Ray from Java, this book is in Python, and we assume a general familiarity with the Python ecosystem. If you are not familiar with Python, excellent O’Reilly titles include <a class="orm:hideurl" href="https://oreil.ly/uPun0"><em>Learning Python</em></a> by Mark Lutz and <a class="orm:hideurl" href="https://oreil.ly/F1xgP"><em>Python for Data Analysis</em></a> by Wes McKinney.</p>

<p><em>Serverless</em> is a bit of a buzzword, and despite its name, the serverless model does involve rather a lot of servers, but the idea is you don’t have to manage them explicitly. For many developers and data scientists, the promise of having things magically scale without worrying about the servers’ details is quite appealing. On the other hand, if you enjoy getting into the nitty-gritty of your servers, deployment mechanisms, and load balancers, this is probably not the book for you—​but hopefully, you will recommend this to your colleagues.</p>

<h1>What You Will Learn</h1>

<p>In reading this book, you will learn how to use your existing Python skills to enable programs to scale beyond a single machine. You will learn about techniques for distributed computing, from remote procedure calls to actors, and all the way to distributed datasets and machine learning. We wrap up this book with a “real-ish” example in <a data-type="xref" href="app01.html#appA">Appendix A</a> that uses many of these techniques to build a scalable backend, while integrating with a Python-based web-application and deploying on Kubernetes.</p>

<section data-pdf-bookmark="A Note on Responsibility" data-type="sect1"><div class="sect1" id="idm45354786077184">
<h1>A Note on Responsibility</h1>

<p>As the saying goes, with great power comes great responsibility. Ray, and tools like it, enable you to build more complex systems handling more data and users. It’s important not to get too excited and carried away solving problems because they are fun, and stop to ask yourself about the impact of your decisions.</p>

<p>You don’t have to search very hard to find stories of well-meaning engineers and data scientists accidentally building models or tools that caused devastating impacts, such as breaking the new United States Department of Veteran Affairs payment system, or hiring algorithms that discriminate on the basis of gender. We ask that you keep this in mind when using your newfound powers, for one never wants to end up in a textbook for the wrong reasons.</p>

<h1>Using Code Examples</h1>

<p>The <a href="https://oreil.ly/scaling-python-with-ray-code">Scaling Python Machine Learning GitHub repository</a> contains most of the examples for this book. Most examples in this book are in the <em>ray_examples</em> directory. Examples related to Dask on Ray are found in the <em>dask</em> directory, and those using Spark on Ray are in the <em>spark</em> directory.</p>

<p>If you have a technical question or a problem using the code examples, please send email to <a class="email" href="mailto:bookquestions@oreilly.com"><em>bookquestions@oreilly.com</em></a>.</p>

<p>This book is here to help you get your job done. In general, if example code is offered with this book, you may use it in your programs and documentation. You do not need to contact us for permission unless you’re reproducing a significant portion of the code. For example, writing a program that uses several chunks of code from this book does not require permission. Selling or distributing examples from O’Reilly books does require permission. Answering a question by citing this book and quoting example code does not require permission. Incorporating a significant amount of example code from this book into your product’s documentation does require permission.</p>

<section data-pdf-bookmark="Acknowledgments" data-type="sect1"><div class="sect1" id="idm45354786386000">
<h1>Acknowledgments</h1>

<p>We would like to acknowledge the contribution of Carlos Andrade Costa, who wrote <a data-type="xref" href="ch08.html#ch08">Chapter 8</a> with us. This book would not exist if not for the communities it is built on. Thank you to the Ray/Berkeley community and the PyData community. Thank you to all the early readers and reviewers for your contributions and guidance. These reviewers include Dean Wampler, Jonathan Dinu, Adam Breindel, Bill Chambers, Trevor Grant, Ruben Berenguel, Michael Behrendt, and many more. A special thanks to Ann Spencer for reviewing the early proposals of what eventually became this and <a class="orm:hideurl" href="https://oreil.ly/fm857"><em>Scaling Python with Dask</em></a> (O’Reilly), which Holden coauthored with Mika Kimmins. Huge thanks to the O’Reilly editorial and production teams, especially Virginia Wilson and Gregory Hyman, for helping us get our writing into shape and tirelessly working with us to minimize errors, typos, etc. Any remaining mistakes are the authors’ fault, sometimes against the advice of our reviewers and editors.</p>








<section data-pdf-bookmark="From Holden" data-type="sect2"><div class="sect2" id="idm45354787518704">
<h2>From Holden</h2>

<p>I would also like to thank my wife and partners for putting up with my long in-the-bathtub writing sessions. A special thank you to Timbit for guarding the house and generally giving me a reason to get out of bed (albeit often a bit too early for my taste).</p>
</div></section>








<section data-pdf-bookmark="From Boris" data-type="sect2"><div class="sect2" id="idm45354787517184">
<h2>From Boris</h2>

<p>I would also like to thank my wife, Marina, for putting up with long writing sessions and sometimes neglecting her for hours, and my colleagues at IBM for many fruitful discussions that helped me better understand the power of Ray.</p>
