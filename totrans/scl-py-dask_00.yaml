  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We wrote this book for data scientists and data engineers familiar with Python
    and pandas who are looking to handle larger-scale problems than their current
    tooling allows. Current PySpark users will find that some of this material overlaps
    with their existing knowledge of PySpark, but we hope they still find it helpful,
    and not just for getting away from the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

- en: If you are not familiar with Python, some excellent O’Reilly titles include
    [*Learning Python*](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/learning-python-5th/9781449355722)
    and [*Python for Data Analysis*](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/python-for-data/9781098104023).
    If you and your team are more frequent users of JVM languages (such as Java or
    Scala), while we are a bit biased, we’d encourage you to check out Apache Spark
    along with [*Learning Spark*](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/learning-spark-2nd/9781492050032)
    (O’Reilly) and [*High Performance Spark*](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/high-performance-spark/9781098145842)
    (O’Reilly).

- en: This book is primarily focused on data science and related tasks because, in
    our opinion, that is where Dask excels the most. If you have a more general problem
    that Dask does not seem to be quite the right fit for, we would (with a bit of
    bias again) encourage you to check out [*Scaling Python with Ray*](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/scaling-python-with/9781098118792)
    (O’Reilly), which has less of a data science focus.

- en: As the saying goes, with great power comes great responsibility. Dask and tools
    like it enable you to process more data and build more complex models. It’s essential
    not to get carried away with collecting data simply for the sake of it, and to
    stop to ask yourself if including a new field in your model might have some unintended
    real-world implications. You don’t have to search very hard to find stories of
    well-meaning engineers and data scientists accidentally building models or tools
    that had devastating impacts, such as increased auditing of minorities, gender-based
    discrimination, or subtler things like biases in [word embeddings](https://oreil.ly/tqjth)
    (a way to represent the meanings of words as vectors). Please use your newfound
    powers with such potential consequences in mind, for one never wants to end up
    in a textbook for the wrong reasons.
