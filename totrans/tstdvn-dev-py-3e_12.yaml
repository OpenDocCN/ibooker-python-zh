    able to congratulate ourselves about now. After all, we’ve got some solid basics
    of TDD and Django under our belts; we’ve got all we need to start building a website.

    some of the trickier but unavoidable aspects of web development: static files,
    form data validation, the dreaded JavaScript, but most hairy of all, deployment
    to a production server.'

    but we will meet several major new concepts and technologies. I’ll only be able
    to dip lightly into each one—​I hope to demonstrate enough of each to get you
    started when you get to your own project, but you will also need to do your own
    reading around when you start to apply these topics in “real life”.

    you may find that taking a little time to run through the [official Django tutorial](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/intro/tutorial01/#creating-models)
    at this point would complement what you’ve learned so far nicely, and will leave
    you more confident with the Django stuff over the next few chapters, so you can
    focus on the core concepts.
