<p><strong>Python starts counting from zero, which should sound familiar.</strong>  In fact, Python has a lot in <strong>common</strong> with other programming languages. There’s <strong>variables</strong>, <strong>loops</strong>, <strong>conditionals</strong>, <strong>functions</strong>, and the like. In this, our opening chapter, we take you on a <strong>high-level</strong> <strong>whistle-stop</strong> <strong>tour</strong> of Python’s basics, introducing the language without getting too much into the weeds. You’ll learn how to <strong>create</strong> and <strong>run</strong> code within VS Code and Jupyter Notebook. You’ll see how lots of programming functionality comes <strong>built-in</strong> to Python, which you’ll <strong>leverage</strong> to get your job done. You’ll also learn that although Python shares a lot of the ideas with other programming languages, how they manifest in your Python code can be, well, <strong>different</strong>. Now, don’t get the wrong idea here: we’re talking different <strong>good</strong>, not different <em>bad</em>. Read on to learn more…</p>

<p><span style="color:#404040">Today’s interview is with a very special guest:</span> <span style="color:#404040"><strong>The Python programming language</strong></span><span style="color:#404040">.</span></p>
<p><strong>Head First:</strong> Let me just say what a pleasure it is to have you here today.</p>
<p><strong>Python:</strong> Why, thank you.</p>
<p><strong>Head First:</strong> You’re regarded as one of the most popular programming languages in use today. Why do you think that is?</p>
<p><strong>Python:</strong> (Blushing) My… that’s high praise indeed. At a guess, I’d say lots of programmers like me.</p>
<p><strong>Head First:</strong> Clearly. But why do you think that is? What makes <em>you</em> so different?</p>
<p><strong>Python:</strong> I don’t think I’m all the different to most other programming languages. I do variables, loops, conditionals, functions, and so on, just like all the others.</p>
<p><strong>Head First:</strong> OK, but what accounts for your success?</p>
<p><strong>Python:</strong> I guess it’s a combination of things.</p>
<p><strong>Head First:</strong> Such as…?</p>
<p><strong>Python:</strong> Well… I’m told I’m easy to read.</p>
<p><strong>Head First:</strong> You mean people know what you’re thinking?!?</p>
<p><strong>Python:</strong> Oh, that’s very funny, and very droll. I am, of course, referring to the fact that my <em>code</em> is easy to read.</p>
<p><strong>Head First:</strong> And why do you think that is?</p>
<p><strong>Python:</strong> For starters, I don’t require semi-colons at the end of my statements, and the use of parentheses around <em>everything</em> is needed less often than with other programming languages. This makes my code very clean, which aids with readability and understanding.</p>
<p><strong>Head First:</strong> What else?</p>
<p><strong>Python:</strong> Well, there’s the indentation thing. IMHO, I get a lot of <em>unjustified</em> flak for this, as I use indentation with whitespace to signal blocks of code. This makes my code look consistent, clean, and readable. On top of this, there’s no needless arguing over the “correct” placement of curly braces.</p>
<p><strong>Head First:</strong> So… no curly braces in your code then?</p>
<p><strong>Python:</strong> There is, actually, just not around blocks. In Python, curly braces surround data <em>not</em> code. To indicate blocks, indent with whitespace.</p>
<p><strong>Head First:</strong> That’s interesting… and I’d imagine programmers used to languages like C, C++, Java, C#, Go, Rust, and so on, struggle with this?</p>
<p><strong>Python:</strong> Yes, sadly old habits do die hard. Now, I’m not just saying this, but after you’ve written code with me, you’ll hardly ever notice the whitespace, as it becomes second nature very quickly. It helps, too, that modern editors are Python-savvy, doing the indentation for you. There’s rarely a reason to complain.</p>
<p><strong>Head First:</strong> Granted, readability is <em>A Good Thing</em>™, but there must be more than that to your popularity?</p>
<p><strong>Python:</strong> There’s also my Standard Library: a collection of included code libraries which help with all manner of programming problems. And, of course, there’s PyPI?</p>
<p><strong>Head First:</strong> Py…P… what?!?</p>
<p><strong>Python:</strong> Py…P…I, which is shorthand for the <em>Python Package Index</em>, an online, globally-accessible repository of shareable third-party Python modules. These help programmers tackle every conceivable programming problem you can think of. It’s a wonderful community resource.</p>
<p><strong>Head First:</strong> So this PyPI thing lets you exploit other programmer’s code <em>without</em> writing your own?</p>
<p><strong>Python:</strong> It sounds kind of seedy when you put it like that…</p>
<p><strong>Head First:</strong> Sorry, perhaps “leverage” is a better word?</p>
<p><strong>Python:</strong> Yes, that’s it: <em>leverage</em>. My guiding philosophy is to ensure programmers only ever write new code when then really have to.</p>
<p><strong>Head First:</strong> How so?</p>
<p><strong>Python:</strong> One word: <em>built-in</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Head First:</strong> That’s two words...</p>
<p><strong>Python:</strong> Yes, but there’s the hyphen... anyway, the bottom line is I’ve more than my Standard Library built-in...</p>
<p><strong>Head First:</strong> ... I’m waiting...</p>
<p><strong>Python:</strong> I’m taking about my <em>other</em> built-ins. For starters, there’s the BIFs, my built-in functions. These are little powerhouses of generic functionality that work in lots of places and situations.</p>
<p><strong>Head First:</strong> Provide our readers with a quick example.</p>
<p><strong>Python:</strong> Consider <strong>len</strong>, which is shorthand for “length”. Give <strong>len</strong> an object, and it reports how big the object is.</p>
<p><strong>Head First:</strong> Thank heavens I’m sitting down.</p>
<p><strong>Python:</strong> Ha ha. I know it sounds trivial, but <strong>len</strong>’s a bit of a wonder. Give <strong>len</strong> a list, and it tells you how many objects are in the list. Give it a string, and <strong>len</strong> tells you how many characters are in the string, and so on and so forth. If an object can report its size, <strong>len</strong> can tell you what it is.</p>
<p><strong>Head First:</strong> So <strong>len</strong> is polymorphic?</p>
<p><strong>Python:</strong> Ooooooh, that’s fancy lingo, isn’t it? <img alt="Image" height="20" src="assets/smile.png" width="20"/> But, yes, like a lot of my BIFs, <strong>len</strong> works with many different objects of many different types. At a push, I’d agree that <strong>len</strong> is polymorphic.</p>
<p><strong>Head First:</strong> So what else makes you popular?</p>
<p><strong>Python:</strong> My engaging personality.</p>
<p><strong>Head First:</strong> More like your <em>frivolous</em> personality. Come on, let’s try to keep this business-like.</p>
<p><strong>Python:</strong> Surely I’m allowed to have a bit of fun? After all, I am named after a 1960’s British comedy troupe.</p>
<p><strong>Head First:</strong> Seriously? Now you’re yanking my chain.</p>
<p><strong>Python:</strong> I’m telling you not a word of a lie. Look it up (see: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/faq/general.xhtml#why-is-it-called-python">https://docs.python.org/3/faq/general.xhtml#why-is-it-called-python</a>). I’m not named after a snake. I’m named after <em>Monty Python’s Flying Circus</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Head First:</strong> If you say so...</p>
<p><strong>Python:</strong> And I’m partial to spam with <em>everything</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Head First:</strong> OK, now you’re just being silly.</p>
<p><strong>Python:</strong> OK, I promise I’ll behave. Go on, ask me another question.</p>
<p><strong>Head First:</strong> What’s your deal with data?</p>
<p><strong>Python:</strong> I just <em>love</em> data. Whether it’s working with my built-in data structures (these are really cool, BTW), or talking to databases, or grabbing data off the web, I’m your go-to data-munging programming language.</p>
<p><strong>Head First:</strong> I guess your love of data reflects your #1 position in the machine learning world, eh?</p>
<p><strong>Python:</strong> I guess so. To be honest, though, I find all that ML stuff a bit highfalutin. I’m just as happy running your functions, ripping through your loops, and helping you to get your work done.</p>
<p><strong>Head First:</strong> But surely the merging of Python, data, and deep learning are a match made in heaven?</p>
<p><strong>Python:</strong> Yes, I guess. But, not everyone needs to do that sort of thing. Don’t get me wrong, I’m thrilled I’m a mover’n’shaker in the AI field, but it’s not like that’s <em>all</em> I do.</p>
<p><strong>Head First:</strong> Care to expand?</p>
<p><strong>Python:</strong> Sure. At my core, I’m a plain-ol’ general purpose programming language, which can be put to many uses. I’m equally happy running your latest webapp as I am running on the <em>Mars Rover</em>. It’s all just code to me. Beautifully formatted, easy to read, <em>code</em>. That’s what it’s all about.</p>
<p><strong>Head First:</strong> I couldn’t agree more. Thanks, Python, for chatting with us today.</p>
<p><strong>Python:</strong> You’re very welcome. See ya!</p>

<h1>there are no Dumb Questions</h1>
<p><span style="color:#412986"><strong>Q:</strong></span> <strong>I’m really surprised those first three lines of code ran at all. Surely those three variables,</strong> <code>suits</code>, <code>faces</code>, <strong>and</strong> <code>numbered</code>, <strong>need to be predeclared with some sort of type?</strong></p>
<p><span style="color:#412986"><strong>A:</strong></span> That may be how some other, more traditional programming languages roll, but not Python. Variables come into existence the moment they are assigned a value, and that value can be of any type. There’s no need to predeclare type information, as Python works this all out dynamically at run-time.</p>
<p><span style="color:#412986"><strong>Q:</strong></span> <strong>Does it matter how I enter my indentation? Can I use the tab key, the space key, or can I use both?</strong></p>
<p><span style="color:#412986"><strong>A:</strong></span> We’d love to tell you that it doesn’t matter, but it does. When it comes to indenting your Python code, you can use spaces or tabs, but <strong>not both</strong> (so, no mixing’n’matching). Why this is so is kind of technical, so we’re not going to get into the weeds on this right now. Our best advice is to configure your editor to automatically replace taps of the tab key with four spaces (and we’re pretty sure VS Code defaults to this behavior). And, yes, there’s it a <em>convention</em> in the Python programming community to indent by four spaces, not by two, and not by eight. You can, of course, ignore this convention if you so wish, but note that most other Python programmers are hard-wired to expect indentation by four spaces. Of course, there’s always the rebels who insist on doing their own thing (we’re looking at <em>you</em>, <em><a href="http://Anvil.Works">Anvil.Works</a></em>).</p>
<p><span style="color:#412986"><strong>Q:</strong></span> <strong>So, pressing Enter doesn’t run my code? I have to keep using the Shift+Enter combination?</strong></p>
<p><span style="color:#412986"><strong>A:</strong></span> Yes, as you are operating within a Jupyter Notebook. Remember: each cell in a notebook is like a little embedded editor. Pressing the <strong>Enter</strong> key terminates the current line of code, then opens up a new line (for you to enter more code). As the <strong>Enter</strong> key is already taken, the Jupyter folk had to come up with another way to run a code cell, settling on <strong>Shift+Enter</strong>.</p>
<p>BTW: On the last page of this chapter, you’ll find a handy cut-out cheatsheet of our most-useful Jupyter keyboard shortcuts. For now, <strong>Shift+Enter</strong> is all you need to know.</p>

<p>Besides Jupyter, there are other ways to run Python code, and you’ll learn about some of them as you work through this book. However, using VS Code with the Jupyter extension is – in our view – the <em>perfect</em> way to read, run, experiment, and play with Python code when first learning the language.

<h1>What if you want a bunch of cards?</h1>
<p>Your <code>draw</code> function is a great start, drawing one card from the deck each time the function is executed. But, what if you want to draw five cards? Or ten? Or twenty? Or all fifty-two, for that matter?</p>
<p>Although you’d be a little off your head to suggest manually invoking your <code>draw</code> function as many times as is needed, most programmers instead reach for a loop. You’ll learn more about Python’s loops later in this book. For now, here’s how you’d use Python’s <strong>for</strong> loop to execute some code a fixed number of times:</p>
<figure class="informal"><div class="figure">
<img alt="Image" height="726" src="assets/ch00-14-01.png" width="977"/>

<p>Of course, the assumption here is that a drawn card is not put pack into the deck of cards. So... unless your playing with “magic cards” (or someone’s up to no good), the fact that this code randomly selects the same card more than once isn’t likely what’s required.</p>
<p>If your goal is to model a deck of cards, the current <code>draw</code> function isn’t up to snuff, is it?</p>

<h1>The Big 4: list, tuple, dictionary, and set</h1>
<p>Python’s excellent built-in support for data structures is legendary, and is often cited as the main reason most Python programmers <em>love</em> Python.</p>
<p>As this is your opening chapter, we’re not going to overload you with any sort of in-depth discussion of these data structures right now. There are lots of pages (entire chapters, in fact) dedicated to <em>The Big 4</em> later in this book.</p>
<p>Although we haven’t called out their use specifically, you have already encountered lists <em>and</em> tuples. While rather cheekily referring to these as <em>arrays</em> earlier, each of these are in fact a bona fide, honest to goodness, Python <strong>list</strong>:</p>
<figure class="informal"><div class="figure">
<img alt="Image" height="281" src="assets/ch00-16-01.png" width="739"/>
<h6/>
</div></figure>
<p>You’ve also seen your fair share of tuples, too. Every time you invoke the <code>draw</code> function, it gives you back a <strong>tuple</strong>:</p>
<figure class="informal"><div class="figure">
<img alt="Image" height="221" src="assets/ch00-16-02.png" width="811"/>
<h6/>
</div></figure>
<p>You’d be forgiven for thinking tuples look at little weird, and we’d have to agree that we think they look a little weird, too. Don’t let this worry you.</p>
<p>You’ll learn more about both lists and tuples later in this book. Although both lists and tuples have their uses, they are not a great fit when it comes to modelling a deck of cards. Some other data structure is needed here. But, which one?</p>

<h1>Model your deck of cards with a...</h1>
<p>Although Python’s <strong>dictionary</strong> data structure is <em>hugely</em> popular, it primarily provides for lookup functionality (which features <em>lots</em> later in this book). Despite this, and like a list and tuple, a dictionary isn’t the best fit for modelling your deck of cards.</p>
<p>Which leaves you with <strong>set</strong>.</p>
<p>Sets in Python are likes sets from Math class: they contain a collection of unique values where duplicates are <em>not</em> allowed. As the code snippet below shows, when you use a Python set, you inherit a method called <strong>add</strong> which – brace yourself – adds a item to an existing set.</p>
<p>Take a look at this loop which uses the three lists from the previous page to construct a deck of cards.</p>

<p><strong>That shouldn’t come as a surprise.</strong></p>
<p>The block of code associated with any loop can contain any other code, including another loop. That’s a given. But, did you notice how Python’s use of indentation makes it easy to work out which block belongs where?</p>

<h1>Use BIFs to learn more about your variables</h1>
<p>Python’s built-in functions have many uses. Although you’re less than twenty pages into this chapter, you’ve already learned a little about <strong>len</strong>, <strong>print</strong>, <strong>range</strong>, and <strong>set</strong>.</p>
<p>We know you’ve been waiting patiently for this... so let’s see <strong>len</strong> in action:</p>
<figure class="informal"><div class="figure">

<h6/>
</div></figure>
<p>As you can no doubt imagine, <strong>len</strong> gets a lot of use. However, the most used BIF is very likely <strong>print</strong>, which – among other things – displays objects on screen. Let’s see what happens when <strong>print</strong> is asked to display your <code>deck</code> variable:</p>

<section data-pdf-bookmark="Chaining BIFs to get more done" data-type="sect1"><div class="sect1" id="chaining_bifs_to_get_more_done">
<h1>Chaining BIFs to get more done</h1>
<p>You can use more than one BIF at a time (should you need to). A great BIF to know about is <strong>sorted</strong>, which returns a sorted copy of any object’s data.</p>
<p>The <strong>sorted</strong> BIF is often combined (or <em>chained</em>) with the <strong>print</strong> BIF to display an ordered version of some data. Care is needed, though, as the ordered data returned by <strong>sorted</strong> is always a list, regardless of what’s being sorted. This means using <strong>sorted</strong> on a set does <em>not</em> produce a sorted set, it produces a <em>sorted list</em> made up from the data in the original, <em>unordered</em> set. The original set is unchanged, in that it’s still a set, which is still unordered.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Remember: “BIF” is shorthand for “built-in function”.</strong></p>

</div></figure>
<p>The <strong>print</strong> <strong>sorted</strong> chain is a great combination, but get ready to type the next chain (shown on the next page) more times that you’ll likely think possible. It really is a common combination, and useful to boot.</p>

<section data-pdf-bookmark="The print dir combo mambo" data-type="sect1"><div class="sect1" id="the_print_dir_combo_mambo">
<h1>The print dir combo mambo</h1>
<p>When provided with the name of any Python object, the <strong>dir</strong> BIF returns a list of the object’s attributes which, in the case of the <code>deck</code> variable, are the attributes associated with a set object.</p>
<p>As you can see (below), there are an awful lot of attributes associated with a Python set. Note how the output from <strong>dir</strong> is chained with a call to the <strong>print</strong> BIF, ensuring the displayed output is drawn <em>across</em> your screen as opposed to <em>down</em> your screen, which cuts down on the amount of scrolling required of your poor fingers. This may or not be something to dance about but – hey! – every little helps.</p>

<p>Here’s a simple rule to follow when looking at the output from <strong>print</strong> <strong>dir</strong>: <em>For now, ignore the attributes which begin and end with a double-underscore</em>. You’ll learn why they exist later in this book, but – for now – ignore, ignore, ignore!</p>

<h1>Getting help with dir’s output</h1>
<p>You might not think this to look at it, but you’ll likely use the <strong>dir</strong> BIF more than any other BIF when working with Python, especially when experimenting within a Jupyter notebook. This is due to <strong>dir</strong>’s ability to fess-up the list of attributes associated with any object. Typically, these attributes include a list of <em>methods</em> which can be applied to the object.</p>
<p>Although it might be tempting (albeit a little bonkers) to randomly execute any of the methods associated with the <code>deck</code> variable to see what they do, a more sensible approach is to read the documentation associated with the method...</p>

<p>Now that your deck of cards is a set, you can better model its behavior.</p>
<p>Sadly, randomly selecting a card from the deck is complicated by the fact the <code>random. choice</code> technique from earlier in this chapter doesn’t work with sets. This is a pity, as it would’ve been nice to use <code>random.choice(deck)</code> to pick a card from your deck but – alas – this won’t work.</p>

<h1>Who Does What? Solution</h1>
<p>We know you’ve yet to look at the PSL in any great detail but, to give you a taste of what’s included, we’ve devised a little test. Without taking a peek at the documentation referred to earlier, your were to consider the names of some of the modules from the PSL shown on the left of this page. Grabbing your pencil, you were to draw an arrow connecting the module name to what you think is the correct description on the right. The first one was done for you. Now you can see our arrows, how did you do?</p>

<p><strong>There sure is a lot going on there.</strong></p>
<p>Our goal is to give you a flavor of what’s in the PSL, not for you to explore it in any great detail.</p>
<p>You are not expected to know all of this, nor remember what’s on the last page, although there are three points you should consider.</p>
<div data-type="note" epub:type="note"><h6>Note</h6>

</div>
<p><span class="inlineimage"><img alt="Images" height="20" src="assets/1-circle.png" width="20"/></span> <strong>You’ve only scratched the surface</strong></p>
<p>The PSL has a lot in it, and what’s on the previous two pages provides the briefest of glimpses. As you work through this book, we’ll call out uses of the PSL so you don’t miss any (and you’ll also find resources in the appendices for further exploring the PSL on your own).</p>
<p><span class="inlineimage"><img alt="Images" height="20" src="assets/2-circle.png" width="20"/></span> <strong>The PSL represents a large body of tested code which you don’t have to write, just use</strong> As the PSL has existed for decades now, the modules it contains have been tested to destruction by legions of Python programmers <em>all over the globe</em>. Consequently, you can use PSL modules with confidence.</p>
<p><span class="inlineimage"><img alt="Images" height="20" src="assets/3-circle.png" width="20"/></span> <strong>The PSL is guaranteed to be there, so you can rely on its modules being available</strong></p>
<p>Other than for some very specific edge cases (such as a tiny embedded micro-controller providing a minimal Python environment), you can be sure your code which uses any PSL module will be portable to other systems which also support the PSL.</p>
<p><strong>Let’s use your latest notebook to take a quick look at two modules from the PSL.</strong></p>

<p>Let’s see two modules from your recent <em>Who Does What?</em> exercise in action. In your <code>WhyPython</code> notebook, type the code below into code cells, remembering to press <strong>Shift+Enter</strong> to execute the cells one-at-a-time. First up is a bit of randomness. Let’s face it, everyone loves random numbers, and the PSL’s <strong>random</strong> module makes generating them super easy:</p>

<p>The PSL’s <strong>collections</strong> module is also very popular, and contains a bunch of containerised data types. A particular favorite is the <strong>Counter</strong> class which automates frequency counting:</p>

<h1>With Python you’ll only write the code you need</h1>
<p>The PSL is an prime example of Python working hard to ensure you only write new code when you absolutely have to. If a module in the PSL solves your problem, use it: <em>Resist the urge to code everything from scratch</em>.</p>
<p>And when it comes to reusing code, there’s more than the PSL to mine.</p>

<h2>Python’s package ecosystem is to die for</h2>
<p>Not being content with what’s already included in the PSL, the Python community supports an online centralised repository of third-party modules, classes, and packages. It’s called the <em>The Python Package Index</em> and lives here: <span style="color:#0045d6"><a href="https://pypi.org/">https://pypi.org/</a></span>.</p>
<p>Known as <em>PyPI</em> (and pronounced “pie-pea-eye”), the index is a huge collection of software. Once you find what you’re looking for, installing is a breeze, and you’ll get lots of practice installing from PyPI as this book progresses.</p>
<p>For now, take ten minutes to visit the PyPI site (shown below) and take a look around.</p>

<p><strong>OK. If it works for you, sure, follow your Zen!</strong></p>
<p>Seriously, though, when a programming language is named in honor of a bunch of comedians, it should come as no surprise that things get a little silly sometimes. This is not a bad thing.</p>
<p>The Python documentation is literally littered (sorry) with references to <em>Monty Python</em>. Where other documentation favors <em>foo</em> and <em>bar</em>, the Python docs favor <em>parrots, spam</em> and <em>eggs</em>. Or is it <em>eggs</em> and <em>spam</em>? Anyway, as the documentation states: you don’t have to like <em>Monty Python</em> to use Python, but it helps.<img alt="Image" height="20" src="assets/smile.png" width="20"/></p>

<p>Python comes with two <em>Easter eggs</em> which demonstrate how Python programmers sometimes don’t take themselves too seriously, and also don’t mind when other folk have a bit of fun at their expense. To see what we mean, return to your WhyPython notebook one last time, and, in two new code cells, run each of the following lines of code. Enjoy!</p>

<p><strong>And we can help you with that.</strong></p>
<p>In the next chapter we introduce – and start <em>immediately</em> working on – a real-world problem which you’ll solve with Python code. Working <em>together</em>, we’ll build a solution while learning more Python, revisiting the material from this chapter in more detail when needed, and as this book progresses.</p>
<p>Before getting to all that, though, take some time to review the chapter summary on the next page before testing your retention skills with this chapter’s crossword puzzle.</p>
<p>See you in the next chapter, <a data-type="xref" href="ch02.xhtml#diving_in_letapostrophes_make_a_splash">Chapter 2</a>, which is actually your <em>second</em> chapter as we starting counting from zero (just like Python).</p>
<aside data-type="sidebar" epub:type="sidebar"><div class="sidebar" id="chapter_review_bullet_points">
<h1>Chapter Review Bullet Points</h1>
<ul>
<li><p>Python is, out of the gate, designed to support the creation of code which is easy to <strong>read</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>Python code is also easy to <strong>run</strong>. Although a number of ways exist to allow you to do this, in this book <strong>VS Code</strong> together with <strong>Jupyter Notebook</strong> are your go-to tools when experimenting and running your Python code.</p>
</li>
<li><p>To get going and be productive with Jupyter Notebook, you need to learn a single keyboard combination: <strong>Shift+Enter</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>In order to ensure you only every write new code when absolutely necessary, Python comes chock-full of <strong>built-in</strong> technology.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The built-in functions (<strong>BIFs</strong>) are always available, and provide a lots of <strong>generic</strong> functionality.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The <strong>len</strong> BIF reports the size of an object.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The <code>def</code> keyword is used to define a <strong>function</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The <strong>range</strong> BIF produces a fixed-size list of numbers (and is really useful with loops when you need to iterate a specific number of times).</p>
</li>
<li><p>Talking of loops, Python provides the <strong>for</strong> loop which iterates a specific number of times.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The <strong>set</strong> BIF creates a set. Sets are one of Python’s Big 4 built-in data structures.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The <strong>print</strong> BIF displays an object’s value on screen. When a collection of objects are printed, the <strong>print</strong> BIF displays horizontally across the screen (which often comes in handy).</p>
</li>
<li><p>The <strong>sorted</strong> BIF returns an ordered copy of some data.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The <strong>dir</strong> BIF returns a list of any object’s attributes.</p>
</li>
<li><p>A common idiom is to combine (or <strong>chain</strong>) the <strong>dir</strong> BIF with the <strong>print</strong> BIF creating (what we like to refer to as) the <strong>print dir combo mambo</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Some of the attributes shown by the combo mambo refer to <strong>methods</strong> which can be applied to the object, for example <code>deck.remove</code>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Attributes with leading and trailing double-underscores are <em>special</em>, so special in fact that you can ignore them for now.</p>
</li>
<li><p>A <strong>list</strong> is made up from a collection of object’s surrounded by square brackets, and is the second of Python’s built-in Big 4 data structures.</p>
</li>
<li><p>A <strong>tuple</strong> is made up from a collection of object’s surrounded by parentheses, and is the third of the Big 4.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The final built-in data structure is the <strong>dictionary</strong>, which wasn’t used in this chapter (only mentioned). This doesn’t mean dictionaries aren’t cool. They are.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The <strong>type</strong> BIF reports any object’s type.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The <strong>in</strong> keyword was shown in two places in this chapter. Once within a <strong>for</strong> loop where it identified the collection to be iterated over, and again on it’s own when it was used to determine if one object is contained within another (aka <em>search</em>).</p>
</li>
<li><p>The <strong>in</strong> keyword is often used within the conditional part of Python’s <strong>if</strong> statement.</p>
</li>
<li><p>When you need a variable but either can’t think of a decent name for your variable or don’t need to remember a value by name, use Python’s <strong>default variable</strong>: a single underscore character (i.e., <code>_</code>). You’ll often see the default variable used with loop code.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Python’s <strong>if</strong> statement can also have an optional <strong>else</strong> part.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Python has two built-in <strong>boolean</strong> values: <code>True</code> and <code>False</code>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The <strong>PSL</strong> has nothing to do with coffee, but everything to do with the <strong>Python Standard Library</strong>. The PSL is a large collection of built-in modules (which come with Python) and can be used all over the place to do many useful things.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If the PSL isn’t enough for you, check out <strong>PyPI</strong>, the <strong>Python Package Index</strong>, an online repository of shareable Python modules. It’s often the case some of the code you need has already been written and uploaded to PyPI as a shareable module. Feel free to “leverage” as needed.</p>
</li>
<li><p>There are other useful <strong>keyboard shortcuts</strong> which you can use when working within Jupyter. Our nine essential shortcuts are coming up after this chapter’s crossword solution (in three pages time).</p>
