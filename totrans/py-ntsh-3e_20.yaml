- en: When a browser (or any other web client) requests a page from a server, the
    server may return either static or dynamic content. Serving dynamic content involves
    server-side web programs generating and delivering content on the fly, often based
    on information stored in a database.
  id: totrans-1
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In the early history of the web, the standard for server-side programming was
    the *Common Gateway Interface* (CGI), which required the server to run a separate
    program each time a client requested dynamic content. Process startup time, interpreter
    initialization, connection to databases, and script initialization add up to measurable
    overhead; CGI did not scale well.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    serving dynamic content from processes that can serve for several hits rather
    than starting up a new process per hit. Therefore, we do not cover CGI in this
    book. To maintain existing CGI programs, or better yet, port them to more modern
    approaches, consult the online docs (especially [PEP 594](https://oreil.ly/qNhHr)

    an implementation detail) respecting conventions in the PEP, and to connect the
    application object to the server by whatever means the specific server documents
    (often a few lines of code, or configuration files, or just a convention such
    as naming the WSGI application object application as a top-level attribute in
    a module). The server calls the application object for each incoming HTTP request,
    and the application object responds appropriately so that the server can form
    the outgoing HTTP response and send it on—all according to said conventions. A
    framework, even a lightweight one, shields you from such details (except that
    you may have to instantiate and connect the application object, depending on the
    specific server).

    or *lightweight* (supplying just a handy interface to web serving itself, and
    letting you pick and choose your own favorite components for tasks such as interfacing
    to databases and templating). Of course, like all taxonomies, this one is imprecise

- en: Whenever you use a lightweight framework, if you need any database, templating,
    or other functionality not strictly related to HTTP, you’ll be picking and choosing
    separate components for that purpose. However, the lighter in weight your framework,
    the more components you will need to understand and integrate, for purposes such
    as authenticating a user or maintaining state across web requests by a given user.
    Many WSGI middleware packages can help you with such tasks. Some excellent ones
    are quite focused—for example, [Oso](https://oreil.ly/zyXl0) for access control,
    [Beaker](https://oreil.ly/v8LxQ) for maintaining state in the form of lightweight
    sessions of any one of several kinds, and so forth.

    just about any purpose, we almost invariably first check [Werkzeug](https://oreil.ly/lF9H3),
    a collection of such components that’s amazing in breadth and quality. We don’t
    cover Werkzeug in this book (just as we don’t cover other middleware), but we

    lightweight framework, which we do cover later in this chapter—is built).

    HTTP (in other words, to know what you’re doing), while a full-stack framework
    tries to lead you by the hand and have you do the right thing without really needing
    to understand how or why it is right—at the cost of time and resources, and of
    accepting the full-stack framework’s conceptual map and mindset. The authors of
    this book are enthusiasts of the knowledge-heavy, resources-light approach of
    lightweight frameworks, but we acknowledge that there are many situations where
    the rich, heavy, all-embracing full-stack frameworks are more appropriate. To
    each their own!

    services, FastAPI aims squarely at producing HTTP-based APIs, as its name suggests.
    It’s also perfectly capable of producing dynamic web pages intended for browser
    consumption, making it a versatile server. FastAPI’s [home page](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com)
    provides simple, short examples showing how it works and highlighting the advantages,

    the Python language, they found wider use than originally intended in tools like
    [pydantic](https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io), which uses them to perform runtime
    parsing and validation. The FastAPI server exploits this support for clean data
    structures, demonstrating great potential to improve web coding productivity through
    built-in and tailored conversion and validation of inputs.

    asynchronous web framework, which in turn uses an ASGI server such as [Uvicorn](https://www.uvicorn.org)
    or [Hypercorn](https://oreil.ly/SXsur). You don’t need to use async techniques
    directly to take advantage of FastAPI. You can write your application in more
    traditional Python style, though it might perform even faster if you do switch
    to the async style.

    (offering no facilities to maintain existing data) shows you how you might do
    this with FastAPI. This example uses the Uvicorn HTTP server, but makes no attempt
    to explicitly use Python’s async features. As with Flask, the program begins by
    creating an application object app. This object has decorator methods for each
    HTTP method, but the app.route decorator (while available) is eschewed in favor
    of app.get for HTTP GET, app.post for HTTP POST, and the like, and those determine
    which view function handles requests to the paths for different HTTP methods.

    by the create_item_from_form function, whose signature takes an argument for each
    form field, with annotations defining each as a form field. Note that the signature
    defines its own default values for description and tax. The function creates an
    MItem object from the form data and tries to save it in the database. The save
    function forces insertions, inhibiting the update of an existing record, and reports
    failure by returning **None**; the return value is used to formulate a simple
    HTML reply. In a production application, a templating engine such as Jinja would
    typically be used to render the response.

    takes JSON input from a POST request. Its signature accepts a pydantic record,

    input is acceptable. The function returns a Python dictionary, which FastAPI automatically
    converts to a JSON response. This can easily be tested with a simple client, shown

    to this day, interfaces between web servers and application frameworks rely on
