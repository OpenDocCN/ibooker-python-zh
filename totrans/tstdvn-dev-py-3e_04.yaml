- en: In this first part, I’m going to introduce the basics of *Test-Driven Development*
    (TDD). We’ll build a real web application from scratch, writing tests first at
    every stage.

- en: We’ll cover functional testing with Selenium, as well as unit testing, and see
    the difference between the two. I’ll introduce the TDD workflow, Red/Green/Refactor.

- en: I’ll also be using a version control system (Git). We’ll discuss how and when
    to do commits and integrate them with the TDD and web development workflow.

- en: We’ll be using Django, the Python world’s most popular web framework (probably).
    I’ve tried to introduce the Django concepts slowly and one at a time, and provide
    lots of links to further reading. If you’re a total beginner to Django, I thoroughly
    recommend taking the time to read them. If you find yourself feeling a bit lost,
    take a couple of hours to go through the [official Django tutorial](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/intro/)
    and then come back to the book.

    to copy and paste code listings from the book as you’re working through it. It’s
    much better if you don’t: typing things in by hand gets them into your muscle
    memory, and just feels much more real. You also inevitably make the occasional
    typo, and debugging them is an important thing to learn.'

    weird stuff often happens when you try to copy/paste from it…​
